<h2><big>BOOK VIII.<br /><br />

EUROPE CONTINUED.&mdash;GREECE.</big><br /><br /></h2>

<p class="center f85">SUMMARY.</p>

<p class="indent">The remaining parts of Macedonia are considered, and the whole of Greece;
on this the author dwells some time on account of the great reputation
of the country. He corrects minutely, and clears up, the confused and
vague accounts respecting the cities contained therein, given by poets and
historians, and especially in the Catalogue and in many other parts of the
Poem.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">After</span> having described as much of the western parts
of Europe as is comprised within the interior and exterior
seas, and surveyed all the barbarous nations which it contains,
as far as the Don<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> and a small part of Greece, [namely,
Macedonia,]<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> we propose to give an account of the remainder
of the Helladic geography. Homer was the first writer on
the subject of geography, and was followed by many others,
some of whom composed particular treatises, and entitled them
&#8220;Harbours,&#8221; &#8220;Voyages,&#8221; &#8220;Circuits of the Earth,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> or gave them
some name of this kind, and these comprised the description
of the Helladic country. Some, as Ephorus and Polybius,
included in their general history a separate topography of
the continents; others, as Posidonius and Hipparchus, introduced
matter relating to geography in their writings on
physical and mathematical subjects.</p>

<p>It is easy to form an opinion of the other writers, but the
poems of Homer require critical consideration, both because
he speaks as a poet, and because he describes things not as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]<br />[CAS. 333]</a></span>
they exist at present, but as they existed anciently, and the
greater part of which have been rendered obscure by time.</p>

<p>We must however undertake this inquiry as far as we are
able, beginning from the point where our description ended.</p>

<p>It ended with an account of the Epirotic and Illyrian nations
on the west and north, and of Macedonia as far as Byzantium
on the east.</p>

<p>After the Epirot&aelig; and Illyrii follow the Acarnanes,[4] the
&AElig;toli, the Locri-Ozol&aelig;, then the Phoc&aelig;enses and B&#339;oti,
Grecian nations. Opposite to these on the other side of the
strait is Peloponnesus, which comprises the Gulf of Corinth,<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a>
interposed between, and determining the figure of the latter,
from which it also receives its own. Next to Macedonia<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a>
are the Thessalians,<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> extending as far as the Malienses,<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> and
the other nations, situated on both sides of the isthmus.</p>

<p>2. There are many Greek tribes, but the chief people are
equal in number to the Greek dialects with which we are
acquainted, namely, four. Of these, the Ionic is the same as
the ancient Attic; (for Iones was the former name of the inhabitants
of Attica; from thence came the Iones who settled
in Asia,<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> and use the dialect now called Ionic;) the Doric was
the same as the &AElig;olic dialect, for all the people on the other
side of the isthmus except the Athenians, the Megareans, and
the Dorians about Parnassus, are even now called &AElig;olians;
it is probable that the Dorians, from their being a small
nation, and occupying a most rugged country, and from want
of intercourse [with the &AElig;olians], no longer resemble that
people either in language or customs, and, although of the
same race, have lost all appearance of affinity. It was the
same with the Athenians, who inhabiting a rugged country
with a light soil, escaped the ravages of invaders. As they
always occupied the same territory, and no enemy attempted to
expel them, nor had any desire to take possession of it themselves,
on this account they were, according to Thucydides,
regarded as Autochthones, or an indigenous race. This was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
probably the reason, although they were a small nation, why
they remained a distinct people with a distinct dialect.</p>

<p>It was not in the parts only on the other side of the isthmus,
that the &AElig;olian nation was powerful, but those on this side
also were formerly &AElig;olians. They were afterwards intermixed
first with Ionians who came from Attica, and got possession
of &AElig;gialus,<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> and secondly with Dorians, who under
the conduct of the Heracleid&aelig; founded Megara and many of
the cities in the Peloponnesus. The Iones were soon expelled
by the Ach&aelig;i, an &AElig;olian tribe; and there remained in Peloponnesus
the two nations, the &AElig;olic and the Doric. Those
nations then that had little intercourse with the Dorians used
the &AElig;olian dialect. (This was the case with the Arcadians
and Eleians, the former of whom were altogether a mountain
tribe, and did not share in the partition of the Peloponnesus;
the latter were considered as dedicated to the service of
the Olympian Jupiter, and lived for a long period in peace,
principally because they were of &AElig;olian descent, and had
admitted into their country the army of Oxylus, about the time
of the return of the Heracleid&aelig;.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a>) The rest used a kind of
dialect composed of both, some of them having more, others
less, of the &AElig;olic dialect. Even at present the inhabitants of
different cities use different dialects, but all seem to Dorize,
or use the Doric dialect, on account of the ascendency of that
nation.</p>

<p>Such then is the number of the Grecian nations, and thus
in general are they distinguished from each other.</p>

<p>I shall resume my account of them, and describe each
nation in their proper order.</p>

<p>3. According to Ephorus, Acarnania is the commencement
of Greece on the west, for it is the first country which lies
contiguous to the Epirotic nations. As this author follows
the coast in his measurements, and begins from thence, considering
the sea the most important guide of topographical
description, (for otherwise he might have placed the beginning
of Greece in Macedonia and Thessaly,) so ought I, observing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]<br />CAS. 334</a></span>
the natural character of places, to keep in view the sea as a
mark by which I should direct the course of my description.</p>

<p>The sea coming from Sicily spreads itself on one side
towards the Corinthian Gulf, and on the other forms a large
peninsula, the Peloponnesus, united to the mainland by a
narrow isthmus.</p>

<p>The two largest bodies of country in Greece are that within
the isthmus, and that without the isthmus, [extending to the
mouths of the river Peneius]. That within the isthmus is however
larger, and more celebrated. The Peloponnesus is, as it
were, the acropolis or citadel of all Greece; and all Greece in
a manner holds the chief or leading position in Europe. For
independently of the fame and power of the nations which
inhabited it, the position itself of the places in it suggests
this superiority. One site succeeds another diversified with
numerous most remarkable bays, and large peninsulas. The
first of these peninsulas is the Peloponnesus, closed in by
an isthmus of forty stadia in extent. The second comprehends
the first, and has an isthmus reaching from Pag&aelig; in
Megaris to Nis&aelig;a, which is the naval arsenal of the Megareans;
the passage across the isthmus from sea to sea is 120
stadia.</p>

<p>The third peninsula also comprises the latter. Its isthmus
extends from the farthest recess of the Criss&aelig;an Gulf to
Thermopyl&aelig;. The line supposed to be drawn between these
is about 508 stadia in length, including within it the whole
of B&#339;otia, and cutting Phocis and the country of the
Epicnemidii obliquely. The fourth peninsula has the isthmus
extending from the Ambracian Gulf through Mount &#338;ta
and Traclinia to the Maliac Gulf and Thermopyl&aelig;, about
800 stadia.</p>

<p>There is another isthmus of more than 1000 stadia reaching
from the same Gulf of Ambracia, and passing through
the country of the Thessalians and Macedonians to the recess
of the Therm&aelig;an Gulf.</p>

<p>The succession of peninsulas furnishes a convenient order
to be followed in describing the country.</p>

<p>We must begin from the smallest, as being also the most
famous of these peninsulas.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></p>

<hr />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">The</span> Peloponnesus resembles in figure the leaf of a plane
tree.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> Its length and breadth are nearly equal, each about
1400 stadia. The former is reckoned from west to east, that
is, from the promontory Chelonatas through Olympia and the
territory Megalopolitis to the isthmus; the latter from south
to north, or from Mali&aelig; though Arcadia to &AElig;gium.</p>

<p>The circumference, according to Polybius, exclusive of the
circuit of the bays, is 4000 stadia. Artemidorus however
adds to this 400 stadia, and if we include the measure of the
bays, it exceeds 5600 stadia. We have already said that the
isthmus at the road where they draw vessels over-land from
one sea to the other is 40 stadia across.</p>

<p>2. Eleians and Messenians occupy the western side of this
peninsula. Their territory is washed by the Sicilian Sea.
They possess the coast also on each side. Elis bends towards
the north and the commencement of the Corinthian Gulf as
far as the promontory Araxus,<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> opposite to which across the
strait is Acarnania; the islands Zacynthus,<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> Cephallenia,<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a>
Ithaca,<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> and the Echinades, to which belongs Dulichium, lie
in front of it. The greater part of Messenia is open to the
south and to the Libyan Sea as far as the islands Thyrides
near T&aelig;narum.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></p>

<p>Next to Elis, is the nation of the Ach&aelig;i looking towards
the north, and stretching along the Corinthian Gulf they
terminate at Sicyonia. Then follow Sicyon<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> and Corinth,
extending as far as the isthmus. Next after Messenia are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]<br />[CAS. 335]</a></span>
Laconia and Argeia, which latter country also reaches as far
as the isthmus.</p>

<p>The bays of the Peloponnesus are the Messeniac,<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> the Laconian,<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a>
a third the Argolic,<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> and a fourth the Hermionic,<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a>
or the Saronic,<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> which some writers call the Salaminiac bay.
Some of these bays are supplied by the Libyan, others by
the Cretan and Myrtoan Seas. Some call even the Saronic
Gulf a sea. In the middle of Peloponnesus is Arcadia, lying
contiguous to all the other nations.</p>

<p>3. The Corinthian Gulf begins from the mouths of the
Evenus,<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> (some say from the mouths of the Achelous,<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> which
is the boundary between the Acarnanes and &AElig;toli,) and from
the promontory Araxus. For there the shores on both sides
first begin to contract, and have a considerable inclination
towards each other; as they advance farther onwards they
nearly meet at Rhium<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> and Antirrhium,<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> leaving a channel of
only about 5 stadia between them.</p>

<p>Rhium is a promontory of Achaia, it is low, and bends inwards
like a sickle, (indeed it has the name of Drepanum, or
the Sickle,) and lies between Patr&aelig;<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> and &AElig;gium,<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> on it there
is a temple of Neptune. Antirrhium is situated on the confines
of &AElig;tolia and Locris. It is called Rhium Molycrium.
From this point the sea-shore again parts in a moderate degree
on each side, and advancing into the Criss&aelig;an Gulf, terminates
there, being shut in by the western boundaries of
B&#339;otia and Megaris.</p>

<p>The Corinthian Gulf is 2230 stadia in circuit from the
river Evenus to the promontory Araxus; and if we reckon
from the Achelous, it would be increased by about 100 stadia.</p>

<p>The tract from the Achelous to the Evenus is occupied by
Acarnanians; next are the &AElig;toli, reaching to the Cape Antirrhium.
The remainder of the country, as far as the isthmus,
is occupied by Phocis, B&#339;otia, and by Megaris, it extends
1118 stadia.</p>

<p>The sea from Cape Antirrhium as far as the isthmus is
[the Criss&aelig;an Gulf, but from the city Creusa it is called the
Sea of] Alcyonis, and is a portion of the Criss&aelig;an Gulf.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>From the isthmus to the promontory Araxus is a distance of
1030 stadia.</p>

<p>Such in general then is the nature and extent of the Peloponnesus,
and of the country on the other side of the strait up
to the farther recess of the gulf. Such also is the nature of
the gulf between both.</p>

<p>We shall next describe each country in particular, beginning
with Elis.</p>

<hr />

<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">At</span> present the whole sea-coast lying between the Ach&aelig;i
and Messenii is called Eleia, it stretches into the inland parts
towards Arcadia at Pholoe, and the Azanes, and Parrhasii.
Anciently it was divided into several states; afterwards
into two, Elis of the Epeii, and Elis under Nestor, the son of
Neleus. As Homer says, who mentions Elis of the Epeii by
name,</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">&#8220;Sacred Elis, where the Epeii rule.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The other he calls Pylus subject to Nestor, through which, he
says, the Alpheius flows:</p>

<p class="small">
&#8220;Alpheius, that flows in a straight line through the land of the Pylians.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a>
</p>

<p>The poet was also acquainted with a city Pylus;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">&#8220;They arrived at Pylus, the well-built city of Neleus.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The Alpheius however does not flow through nor beside the
city, but another river flows beside it, which some call
Pamisus, others Amathus, from which Pylus seems to be
termed Emath&ouml;eis, but the Alpheius flows through the Eleian
territory.</p>

<p>2. Elis, the present city, was not yet founded in the time
of Homer, but the inhabitants of the country lived in villages.
It was called C&#339;le [or Hollow] Elis, from the accident of its
locality, for the largest and best part of it is situated in a
hollow. It was at a late period, and after the Persian war,
that the people collected together out of many demi, or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]<br />[CAS. 337]</a></span>
burghs, into one city. And, with the exception of a few, the
other places in the Peloponnesus which the poet enumerates
are not to be called cities, but districts. Each contained several
assemblages of demi or burghs, out of which the famous
cities were afterwards formed, as Mantineia in Arcadia, which
was furnished with inhabitants from five burghs by Argives;
Tegea from nine; Her&aelig;a from as many during the reign of
Cleombrotus, or Cleonymus; &AElig;gium out of seven, or eight;
Patr&aelig; out of seven; Dyme out of eight; thus Elis also was
formed out of the surrounding burghs. The demus of the
Agriades was one of those added to it. The Peneius<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> flows
through the city by the Gymnasium, which the Eleii constructed
long after the countries which were subject to Nestor
had passed into their possession.</p>

<p>3. These were the Pisatis, of which Olympia is a part, and
Triphylia, and the territory of the Caucones. The Triphylii
had their name from the accident of the union of three tribes;
of the Epeii, the original inhabitants; of the Miny&aelig;, who
afterwards settled there; and last of all of the Eleii, who
made themselves masters of the country. Instead of the Miny&aelig;
some writers substitute Arcadians, who had frequently disputed
the possession of the territory, whence Pylus had the
epithet Arcadian as well as Triphylian. Homer calls all this
tract as far as Messene by the name of Pylus, the name of the
city. The names of the chiefs, and of their abodes in the
Catalogue of the Ships, show that C&#339;le Elis, or the Hollow
Elis, was distinct from the country subject to Nestor.</p>

<p>I say this on comparing the present places with Homer&#8217;s
description of them, for we must compare one with the other
in consideration of the fame of the poet, and our being bred
up in an acquaintance with his writings; and every one will
conclude that our present inquiry is rightly conducted, if
nothing is found repugnant to his accounts of places, which
have been received with the fullest reliance on their credibility
and his veracity.</p>

<p>We must describe these places as they exist at present, and
as they are represented by the poet, comparing them together
as far as is required by the design of this work.</p>

<p>4. The Araxus is a promontory of Eleia situated on the
north, 60 stadia from Dyme, an Ach&aelig;an city. This promontory
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
we consider the commencement of the coast of Eleia. Proceeding
thence towards the west is Cyllene,<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> the naval arsenal
of the Eleii, from whence is an ascent of 120 stadia to the present
city. This Cyllene Homer mentions in these words,</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">&#8220;Cyllenian Otus, chief of the Epeii,&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>for he would not have given the title of chief of Epeii to one
who came from the Arcadian mountain of this name. It is a
village of moderate size, in which is preserved the &AElig;sculapius
of Colotes, a statue of ivory, of admirable workmanship.</p>

<p>Next to Cyllene is the promontory Chelonatas,<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> the most
westerly point of the Peloponnesus. In front of it there is a
small island and shoals on the confines of Hollow Elis, and the
territory of the Pisat&aelig;. From hence [Cyllene] to Cephallenia
is a voyage of not more than 80 stadia. Somewhere on the
above-mentioned confines is the river Elisson, or Elissa.</p>

<p>5. Between the Chelonatas and Cyllene the river Peneius
empties itself, and that also called by the poet Selle&iuml;s, which
flows from the mountain Pholoe. On this river is situated
Ephyra, a city to be distinguished from the Thesprotian,
Thessalian, and Corinthian Ephyras; being a fourth city of
this name, situated on the road leading to the Lasion sea-coast,
and which may be either the same place as B&#339;onoa,
(for it is the custom to call &#338;noe by this name,) or a city
near this, distant from Elis 120 stadia. This Ephyra seems
to be the reputed birth-place of Astyochea, the mother of Tlepolemus,
the son of Hercules,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">&#8220;Whom Hercules brought from Ephyra, from the river Selleis;&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>(for this was the principal scene of the adventures of Hercules;
at the other places called Ephyra, there is no river
Selleis;) hence came the armour of Meges,</p>

<p class="small">
&#8220;Which Phyleus formerly brought from Ephyra, from the river Selleis;&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a>
</p>

<p>from this Ephyra came also mortal poisons. For Minerva
says, that Ulysses went to Ephyra</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">&#8220;In search of a mortal poison wherewith to anoint his arrows:&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>And the suitors say of Telemachus;</p>

<p class="small">
&#8220;Or he will go to the rich country of Ephyra to bring back poison destructive of our lives.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a>
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]<br />[CAS. 338]</a></span></p>

<p>And Nestor introduces the daughter of Augeas, king of the
Epeii, in his account of the war with that people, as one who
administered poisons:</p>

<p class="small">
&#8220;I first slew a man,<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> Mulius, a brave soldier. He was son-in-law of
Augeas; he had married his eldest daughter; she was acquainted with
all the poisons which the earth brings forth.&#8221;</p>

<p>There is also near Sicyon a river, Selleis, and a village of
the name of Ephyra near it; and a village Ephyra in the
territory of Agr&aelig;a in &AElig;tolia, the people of which are called
Ephyri. There are also other Ephyri among the Perrh&aelig;bi
near Macedonia, who are Crannonians,<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> and the Thesprotic
Ephyri of Cichyrus, which was formerly called Ephyra.</p>

<p>6. Apollodorus, when he informs us in what manner the
poet usually distinguishes places with the same names, as
Orchomenus for instance, designating that in Arcadia by the
epithet, &#8220;abounding with sheep;&#8221; the B&#339;otian Orchomenus,
as &#8220;Minye&iuml;us;&#8221; by applying to Samos the term Thracian,
and adds,</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;Between Samos and Imbros,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>to distinguish it from Ionian Samos; so he says the Thesprotic
Ephyra is distinguished from others by the words, &#8220;at
a distance,&#8221; and &#8220;from the river Selleis.&#8221; This does not
agree with what Demetrius of Scepsis says, from whom he
borrows most of his information. For Demetrius does not
say that there is a river Selleis in Thesprotia, but in Elis,
near the Thesprotic Ephyra, as I have said before.</p>

<p>What he says also about &#338;chalia requires examination,
where he asserts that the city of Eurytus of &#338;chalia is the
only city, when there is more than one city of that name. It
is therefore evident that he means the Thessalian city mentioned
by Homer:</p>

<p class="small">
&#8220;And they who occupied &#338;chalia, the city of Eurytus, the &#338;chalian.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a>
</p>

<p>What city, then, is that on the road from which &#8220;Thamyris
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
the Thracian was met by the Muses, and deprived of the
power of song,&#8221; for he says,</p>

<p class="small">
&#8220;Coming from &#338;chalia, from the dwelling of Eurytus, the &#338;chalian.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a>
</p>

<p>If this were the city in Thessaly, the Scepsian is mistaken in
mentioning some city in Arcadia, which is now called Andania.
If he is not mistaken, still the Arcadian &#338;chalia is said to
be the city of Eurytus, so that there is not one city only of
that name, although Apollodorus asserts that there is but one.</p>

<p>7. There existed between the mouths of the Peneius and
the Selleis near Scollis, a Pylus, not the city of Nestor, but
another of that name, having nothing in common with that
on the Alpheius, nor even with that on the Pamisus, or, if
we must so call it, the Amathus. Some writers, through their
solicitude for the fame and noble descent of Nestor, give a
forced meaning to these words. Since there are three places
in Peloponnesus of the name of Pylus, (whence the saying
originated,</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;There is a Pylus in front of Pylus, and still there is another Pylus,&#8221;)</p>

<p>namely, this and the Lepreatic Pylus in Triphylia, and a
third, the Messeniac near Coryphasium,<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> the advocates for
each place endeavour to show that the river in his own country
is (Emathois) &#7968;&#956;&#945;&#952;&#8057;&#949;&#953;&#962; or sandy, and declare that to be
the country of Nestor.</p>

<p>The greater number of other writers, both historians and
poets, say, that Nestor was a Messenian, assigning as his birth-place
the Pylus, which continued to exist to their times.
Those, however, who adhere to Homer and follow his poem as
their guide, say, that the Pylus of Nestor is where the territory
is traversed by the Alpheius. Now this river passes
through the Pisatis and Triphylia. The inhabitants of the
Hollow Elis were emulous of the same honour respecting the
Pylus in their own country, and point out distinctive marks,
as a place called Gerenus, and a river Geron, and another
river Geranius, and endeavour to confirm this opinion by
pretending that Nestor had the epithet Gerenius from these
places.</p>

<p>The Messenians argue in the very same manner, but apparently
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]<br />[CAS. 340]</a></span>
with more probability on their side. For they say,
that in their territory there is a place better known, called
Gerena, and once well inhabited.</p>

<p>Such then is the present state of the Hollow Elis.<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a></p>

<p>8. The poet however, after having divided the country into
four parts, and mentioned the four chiefs, does not clearly
express himself, when he says:</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;those who inhabit Buprasium and the sacred Elis, all whom Hyrmin&#275;
and Myrsinus, situated at the extremity of the territory and the Olenian
rock, and Aleisium contain, these were led by four chiefs; ten swift vessels
accompanied each, and multitudes of Epeii were embarked in them.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a></p>

<p>For, by applying the name Epeii to both people, the Buprasians
and the Eleii, and by never applying the name Eleii to
the Buprasians, he may seem to divide, not Eleia, but the
country of the Epeii, into four parts, which he had before
divided into two; nor would Buprasium then be a part of Elis,
but rather of the country of the Epeii. For that he terms
the Buprasians Epeii, is evident from these words:</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;As when the Epeii were burying King Amarynces at Buprasium.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a></p>

<p>Again, by enumerating together &#8220;Buprasium and sacred
Elis,&#8221; and then by making a fourfold division, he seems to
arrange these very four divisions in common under both Buprasium
and Elis.</p>

<p>Buprasium, it is probable, was a considerable settlement in
Eleia, which does not exist at present. But the territory only
has this name, which lies on the road to Dyme from Elis the
present city. It might be supposed that Buprasium had at
that time some superiority over Elis, as the Epeii had over
the Eleii, but afterwards they had the name of Eleii instead
of Epeii.</p>

<p>Buprasium then was a part of Elis, and they say, that
Homer, by a poetical figure, speaks of the whole and of the
part together, as in these lines:</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;through Greece and the middle of Argos;&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> &#8220;through Greece and
Phthia;&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> &#8220;the Curetes and the &AElig;toli were fighting;&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> &#8220;those from
Dulichium and the sacred Echinades;&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a></p>

<p>for Dulichium is one of the Echinades. Modern writers also
use this figure, as Hipponax,</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p class="small">&#8220;they eat the bread of the Cyprians and the wheat of the Amathusii;&#8221;</p>

<p>for the Amathusii are Cyprians: and Alcman;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;leaving the beloved Cyprus, and Paphos, washed on all sides by the sea:&#8221;</p>

<p>and &AElig;schylus;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;possessing as your share by lot the whole of Cyprus and Paphos.&#8221;
</p>

<p>If Homer has not called the Buprasii by the name of Eleii,
we shall reply, nor has he mentioned many other places and
things which exist. For this is not a proof that they did not
exist, but only that he has not mentioned them.</p>

<p>9. But Hecat&aelig;us of Miletus says, that the Epeii are a
different people from the Eleii; that the Epeii accompanied
Hercules in his expedition against Augeas, and joined him in
destroying Elis, and defeating Augeas. He also says, that
Dyme was both an Epeian and an Ach&aelig;an city.</p>

<p>The ancient historians, accustomed from childhood to
falsehood through the tales of mythologists, speak of many
things that never existed. Hence they do not even agree
with one another, in their accounts of the same things.
Not that it is improbable that the Epeii, although a different
people and at variance with the Eleii, when they
had gained the ascendency, united together, forming a common
state, and their power extended even as far as Dyme.
The poet does not mention Dyme, but it is not improbable
that at that time it was subject to the Epeii, and afterwards
to the Iones, or perhaps not even to this people, but to the
Ach&aelig;i, who were in possession of the country of the Iones.</p>

<p>Of the four portions, which include Buprasium, Hyrmin&#275;
and Myrsinus belong to the territory of Eleia. The rest,
according to the opinion of some writers, are situated close
on the borders of the Pisatis.</p>

<p>10. Hyrmin&#275; was a small town, which exists no longer,
but there is a mountainous promontory near Cyllene, called
Hormina or Hyrmina.</p>

<p>Myrsinus is the present Myrtuntium, a settlement extending
to the sea, and situated on the road from Dyme to Elis, at
the distance of 70 stadia from the city of the Eleii.</p>

<p>It is conjectured that the Olenian rock is the present Scollis.
For we might mention probable conjectures, since both places
and names have undergone changes, and the poet himself
does not explain his meaning clearly in many passages.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]<br />[CAS. 341]</a></span></p>

<p>Scollis is a rocky mountain, common to the Dym&aelig;i, and
Trit&aelig;enses, and Eleii, situated close to Lampeia, another mountain
in Arcadia, which is distant from Elis 130 stadia, from
Trit&aelig;a 100, and an equal number [from Dyme] Ach&aelig;an cities.</p>

<p>Aleisium is the present Alesi&aelig;um, a place near Amphidolis,
where the neighbouring people hold a market every month.
It is situated upon the mountain road leading from Elis to
Olympia. Formerly, it was a city of the Pisatis, the boundaries
of the country being different at different times on account
of the change of masters. The poet also calls Aleisium,
the hill of Aleisius, when he says,</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;Till we brought our horses to Buprasium rich in grain, and to the
Olenian rock, and to the place which is called the hill of Aleisium,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a></p>

<p>for we must understand the words by the figure hyperbaton.
Some also point out a river Aleisius.</p>

<p>11. Since a tribe of Caucones is mentioned in Triphylia
near Messenia, and as Dyme is called by some writers
Cauconis, and since between Dyme and Trit&aelig;a in the Dym&aelig;an
district there is also a river called Caucon, a question arises
respecting the Caucones, whether there are two nations of this
name, one situate about Triphylia, and another about Dyme,
Elis, and Caucon. This river empties itself into another
which is called Teutheas, in the masculine gender, and is the
name of a small town that was one of those that composed
Dyme; except that the town is of the feminine gender, and is
pronounced Teuthea, without the s, and the last syllable is long.</p>

<p>There is a temple of Diana Nemydia (Neme&aelig;a?). The
Teutheas discharges itself into the Achelous, which runs by
Dyme, and has the same name as that in Acarnania, and the
name also of Peirus. In the lines of Hesiod,</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;he lived near the Olenian rock on the banks of the broad Peirus,&#8221;</p>

<p>some change the last word &#928;&#949;&#8055;&#961;&#959;&#953;&#959; to &#928;&#8061;&#961;&#959;&#953;&#959;, but improperly.
<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a>[But it is the opinion of some writers, who make the
Caucones a subject of inquiry, that when Minerva in the
Odyssey, who has assumed the form of Mentor, says to Nestor;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;At sunrise I go to the magnanimous Caucones, where a debt neither of
a late date nor of small amount is owing to me.<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> When Telemachus
comes to thy house send him with thy son, thy chariot, and thy horses;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>a certain district in the territory of the Epeii appears to be
designated, which the Caucones, a different nation from that
in Triphylia, possessed, and who perhaps extended even as far
as the Dymean territory.] But it was not proper to omit,
whence Dyme had the name Cauconitis, nor why the river was
called Caucon, because the question is, who the Caucones<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a>
were, to whom Minerva says, she is going to recover a debt.
For if we understand the poet to mean those in Triphylia
about Lepreum, I know not how this is probable; whence
some persons even write the passage,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">&#8220;where a large debt is owing to me in the sacred Elis.&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>This will appear more clearly, when we describe the Pisatis,
and after it Triphylia as far as the confines of Messenia.</p>

<p>12. Next to the Chelonatas is the long tract of coast of the
Pisat&aelig;; then follows a promontory, Pheia; there was also a
small town of this name;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">&#8220;by the walls of Pheia about the stream of the Jardanes,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>for there is a small river near it.</p>

<p>Some writers say, that Pheia is the commencement of the
Pisatis. In front of Pheia is a small island and a harbour;
thence to Olympia by sea, which is the shortest way, is
120 stadia. Then immediately follows another promontory,
[Icthys,] projecting very far towards the west, like the
Chelonatas; from this promontory to Cephallenia are 120
stadia. Next the Alpheius discharges itself, at the distance
from the Chelonatas of 280, and from the Araxus of 545,
stadia. It flows from the same places as the Eurotas. There
is a village of the name of Asea in the Megalopolitis, where
the two sources, whence the above-mentioned rivers issue, are
near to one another. After running under the earth the distance
of many stadia, they then rise to the surface, when one
takes its course to Laconia, the other to the Pisatis. The
Eurotas reappears at the commencement of the district Bleminates,
flowing close beside Sparta, and passing through a
long valley near Helos, which the poet mentions, empties itself
between Gythium, the naval arsenal of Sparta, and Acræa.
But the Alpheius, after receiving the Celadon, (Ladon?) and
Erymanthus, and other obscure streams, pursues its course
through Phrixa, and the Pisatis, and Triphylia, close to Olympia,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]<br />[CAS. 343]</a></span>
and discharges itself into the Sicilian Sea between Pheia and
Epitalium. At its mouth, and at the distance of 80 stadia
from Olympia, is situated the grove of Artemis Alpheionia,
or Alpheiusa, for both words are in use. At Olympia an
annual festival, to which multitudes resort, is celebrated in
honour of this goddess, as well as of Diana Elaphia and
Diana Daphnia. The whole country is full of temples dedicated
to Diana, and Aphrodite, and the Nymphs, which are
situated amidst flowery groves, and generally where there is
abundance of water. Hermeia, or images of Mercury, are
frequently met with on the road, and on the sea-shore, temples
dedicated to Neptune. In the temple of Diana Alpheionia
are pictures by Cleanthes and Aregon, Corinthian painters;
the former has depicted the taking of Troy, and the birth of
Minerva; the latter, Diana borne upon a griffin; which are
highly esteemed.</p>

<p>13. Next is the mountain, which separates Macistia in
Triphylia from the Pisatis; then follows another river Chalcis,
and a spring called Cruni, and Chalcis a village, and next to
these the Samicum, where is the temple of the Samian Neptune,
which is held in the highest honour. There is also a
grove full of wild olive trees. It was intrusted to the care
of the Macistii, whose business it was to announce the Samian
truce as it is called. All the Triphylii contribute to the temple.</p>

<p>[The temple of the Scilluntian Minerva at Scillus in the
neighbourhood of Olympia, opposite the Phellon, is among
the celebrated temples.]<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a></p>

<p>14. Near these temples, at the distance of 30 stadia, or a
little more, above the sea-coast, is situated the Triphyliac, or
Lepreatic, Pylus, which the poet calls Emathoeis, or Sandy,
and transmits to us as the native country of Nestor, as may
be collected from his poetry. It had the epithet Emathoeis
either from the river, which flows by the city towards the
north, and was formerly called Amathus, but now Mamaus,
or Arcadicus; or because this river was called Pamisus, the
same name as that of two rivers in Messenia, while with
respect to the city, the epithet Emathoeis, or sandy, is of uncertain
origin, since it is not the fact, it is said, that either
the river or the country abounds with sand.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>Towards the east is a mountain near Pylus, named after
Minthe, who, according to the fable, was the mistress of
Hades, and being deluded by Proserpine, was transformed
into the garden mint, which some call hedyosmus, or the
sweet-smelling mint. There is also near the mountain an enclosure,
sacred to Hades, held in great veneration by the
Macistii; and a grove dedicated to Ceres, situated above the
Pyliac plain. This plain is fertile, and situated close to the
sea-coast; it extends along the interval between the Samicum
and the river Neda. The sea-shore is sandy and narrow, so
that no one could be censured for asserting that Pylus was
called &#8220;sandy&#8221; from this tract.</p>

<p>15. Towards the north there were two small Triphyliac
towns, Hypana and Typane&aelig;, bordering upon Pylus; the
former of which was incorporated with Elis, the other remained
separate. Two rivers flow near, the Dalion and the
Acheron, and empty themselves into the Alpheius. The
Acheron has its name from its relation to Hades. For at that
place were held in extraordinary reverence the temples of
Ceres, Proserpine, and Hades, perhaps on account of the contrariety
of the properties of the country, which Demetrius
of Scepsis mentions. For Triphylia is fertile, but the soil is
subject to mildew, and produces rushes,<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> whence in these
places, instead of the product being large, there is frequently
no crop whatever.</p>

<p>16. Towards the south of Pylus is Lepreum. This also
was a city, situated 40 stadia above the sea-coast. Between
the Lepreum and the Annius (Anigrus? Alph&aelig;us?) is the
temple of the Samian Neptune. These places are distant 100
stadia from each other. This is the temple in which the poet
says that the Pylii were found by Telemachus engaged in
offering sacrifice:</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;They came to Pylus, the well-built city of Neleus; the people were
sacrificing on the sea-shore bulls, entirely black, to Neptune, the god of
the dark locks, who shakes the earth.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a></p>

<p>For the poet was at liberty to feign things which did not
exist, but when it is possible to adapt poetry to reality, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]<br />[CAS. 345]</a></span>
preserve the narrative ... it is better to abstain from
fiction.</p>

<p>The Lepreat&aelig; possessed a fertile country, on the confines of
which were situated the Cyparissenses. But Caucones were
masters of both these tracts, and even of the Macistus, which
some call Platanistus. The town has the same name as the
territory. It is said, that in the Lepreatis there is even a
monument of a Caucon, who had the name of the nation,
either because he was a chief, or for some other reason.</p>

<p>17. There are many accounts respecting the Caucones.
They are said to be an Arcadian tribe, like the Pelasgi, and
also, like them, a wandering people. Thus the poet relates,
that they came as auxiliaries to the Trojans, but from what
country he does not mention, but it is supposed from Paphlagonia.
For in that country there is a tribe of the name of
Cauconiat&aelig;, that border upon the Mariandyni, who are themselves
Paphlagonians. We shall say more of them when we
describe that country.<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a></p>

<p>At present I must add some remarks concerning the
Caucones in Triphylia. For some writers say, that the
whole of the present Elis, from Messenia to Dyme, was called
Cauconia. Antimachus calls them all Epeii and Caucones.
But some writers say that they did not possess the whole
country, but inhabited it when they were divided into two
bodies, one of which settled in Triphylia towards Messenia,
the other in the Buprasian district towards Dyme, and in
the Hollow Elis. And there, and not in any other place,
Aristotle considered them to be situated. The last opinion
agrees better with the language of Homer, and the preceding
question is resolved. For Nestor is supposed to have lived at
the Triphyliac Pylus, the parts of which towards the south
and the east (and these coincide towards Messenia and Laconia)
was the country subject to Nestor, but the Caucones
now occupy it, so that those who are going from Pylus to
Laced&aelig;mon must necessarily take the road through the
Caucones. The temple of the Samian Neptune, and the
naval station near it, where Telemachus landed, incline to the
west and to the north. If then the Caucones lived there only,
the account of the poet must be erroneous.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>[For, according to Sotades, Minerva enjoins Nestor to send
his son with Telemachus in a chariot to Laced&aelig;mon towards
the east, while she herself returns back to the west, to pass the
night in the vessel;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;but at sunrise she sets out to the magnanimous Caucones,&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>to obtain payment of the debt, in a forward direction. How
then are we to reconcile these opinions? for Nestor might
say, &#8220;The Caucones are my subjects, and lie directly in the
road of persons who are going to Laced&aelig;mon; why then
do you not accompany Telemachus and his friends on his
journey, but take a road in an opposite direction?&#8221; Besides,
it was natural for one, who was going to recover payment of
a debt, and that a considerable sum, as she says, from a people
under the command of Nestor, to request some assistance from
him in case they should be so unjust, as usually happens, as to
refuse to discharge it. But she did not do this.</p>

<p>If therefore the Caucones are to be found in one situation
only, these absurdities would follow. But if one division of
this tribe occupied the places in Elis near Dym&#275;, Minerva
might be said to direct her journey thither, and even the
return to the ship would not be absurd, nor the separation
from the company of Telemachus, when her road was in an
opposite direction.</p>

<p>The question respecting Pylus may perhaps be resolved in
a similar manner, when we come, as we proceed, to the description
of the Messenian Pylus.<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a>]</p>

<p>18. There is also, it is said, a nation, the Paroreat&aelig;, who
occupy, in the hilly district of Triphylia, the mountains,
which extend from about Lepreum and Macistum to the sea
near the Samian grove sacred to Neptune.</p>

<p>19. Below these people on the coast are two caves; one, of
the nymphs Anigriades; the other, the scene of the adventures
of the Atlantides,<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> and of the birth of Dardanus. There
also are the groves, both the Ion&aelig;um and Eurycydeium.</p>

<p>Samicum is a fortress. Formerly there was a city of the
name of Samos, which perhaps had its designation from its
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]<br />[CAS. 346]</a></span>
height, since they called heights Sami; perhaps also this was
the acropolis of Ar&#275;n&#275;, which the poet mentions in the
Catalogue of the Ships;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;who inhabited Pylus, and the pleasant Arene;&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>for as the position of Ar&#275;n&#275; has not been clearly discovered
anywhere, it is conjectured, that it was most probably situated
where the adjoining river Anigrus, formerly called
Minyeius, empties itself. As no inconsiderable proof of this,
Homer says,</p>

<p class="small">
&#8220;There is a river Minyeius, which empties itself into the sea, near Arene.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a>
</p>

<p>Now near the cave of the nymphs Anigriades is a fountain,
by which the subjacent country is rendered marshy, and filled
with pools of water. The Anigrus however receives the greater
part of the water, being deep, but with so little current
that it stagnates. The place is full of mud, emits an offensive
smell perceptible at a distance of 26 stadia, and renders the
fish unfit for food. Some writers give this fabulous account
of these waters, and attribute the latter effect to the venom
of the Hydra, which some of the Centaurs<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> washed from
their wounds; others say, that Melampus used these cleansing
waters for the purification of the Pr&#339;tades.<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> They are a
cure for alphi, or leprous eruptions, and the white tetter, and
the leichen. They say also that the Alpheus had its name
from its property of curing the disease alphi.<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a></p>

<p>Since then the sluggishness of the Anigrus, and the recoil
of the waters of the sea, produce a state of rest rather than a
current, they say, that its former name was Minye&iuml;us, but
that some persons perverted the name and altered it to
Minte&iuml;us. The etymology of the name may be derived from
other sources; either from those who accompanied Chloris,
the mother of Nestor, from the Minyeian Orchomenus; or,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
from the Miny&aelig; descendants of the Argonauts, who were
banished from Lemnos, and went to Laced&aelig;mon, and thence
to Triphylia, and settled about Ar&#275;n&#275;, in the country now
called Hyp&aelig;sia, which however no longer contains places
built by the Miny&aelig;.</p>

<p>Some of these people, with Theras the son of Autesion,
who was a descendant of Polynices, having set sail to the
country between Cyren&aelig;a and the island of Crete, &#8220;formerly
Calliste, but afterwards called Thera,&#8221; according to Callimachus,
founded Thera, the capital of Cyrene, and gave the
same name to the city, and to the island.</p>

<p>20. Between the Anigrus and the mountain from which
the Jardanes rises, a meadow and a sepulchre are shown,
and the Ach&aelig;&aelig;, which are rocks broken off from the same
mountain, above which was situated, as I have said, the
city Samos. Samos is not mentioned by any of the authors
of Peripli, or Circumnavigations; because perhaps it had
been long since destroyed, and perhaps also on account of its
position. For the Poseidium is a grove, as I have said, near
the sea, a lofty eminence rises above it, situated in front of the
present Samicum, where Samos once stood, so that it cannot
be seen from the sea.</p>

<p>Here also is the plain called Samicus, from which we may
further conjecture that there was once a city Samos.</p>

<p>According to the poem Rhadin&#275;, of which Stesichorus
seems to have been the author, and which begins in this
manner,</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;Come, tuneful Muse, Erato, begin the melodious song, in praise of the
lovely Samian youths, sounding the strings of the delightful lyre:&#8221;</p>

<p>these youths were natives of this Samos. For he says that
Rhadin&#275; being given in marriage to the tyrant, set sail from
Samos to Corinth with a westerly wind, and therefore certainly
not from the Ionian Samos. By the same wind her
brother, who was archi-theorus, arrived at Delphi. Her
cousin, who was in love with her, set out after her in a
chariot to Corinth. The tyrant put both of them to death,
and sent away the bodies in a chariot, but changing his mind,
he recalled the chariot, and buried them.</p>

<p>21. From this Pylus and the Lepreum to the Messenian
Pylus<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> and the Coryphasium, fortresses situated upon the sea,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]<br />[CAS. 348]</a></span>
and to the adjoining island Sphagia, is a distance of about
400 stadia, and from the Alpheius a distance of 750, and
from the promontory Chelonatas 1030 stadia. In the intervening
distance are the temple of the Macistian Hercules,
and the river Acidon, which flows beside the tomb of Jardanus,
and Chaa, a city which was once near Lepreum, where also is
the &AElig;pasian plain. It was for this Chaa, it is said, that the
Arcadians and Pylians went to war with each other, which
war Homer has mentioned, and it is thought that the verse
ought to be written,</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;Oh that I were young as when multitudes of Pylii, and of Arcades,
handling the spear, fought together at the swift-flowing Acidon near the
walls of Chaa,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a></p>

<p>not Celadon, nor Pheia, for this place is nearer the tomb of
Jardanus and the Arcades than the other.</p>

<p>22. On the Triphylian Sea are situated Cyparissia, and
Pyrgi, and the rivers Acidon and Neda. At present the
boundary of Triphylia towards Messenia is the impetuous
stream of the Neda descending from the Lyc&aelig;us, a mountain
of Arcadia, and rising from a source which, according to the
fable, burst forth to furnish water in which Rhea was to wash
herself after the birth of Jupiter. It flows near Phigalia, and
empties itself into the sea where the Pyrgit&aelig;, the extreme
tribe of the Triphylii, approach the Cyparissenses, the first of
the Messenian nation. But, anciently, the country had other
boundaries, so that the dominions of Nestor included some
places on the other side of the Neda, as the Cyparisse&iuml;s, and
some others beyond that tract, in the same manner as the poet
extends the Pylian sea as far as the seven cities, which Agamemnon
promised to Achilles,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">&#8220;All near the sea bordering upon the sandy Pylus,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>which is equivalent to, near the Pylian sea.</p>

<p>23. Next in order to the Cyparisse&iuml;s in traversing the
coast towards the Messenian Pylus and the Coryphasium, we
meet with Erana, (Eranna,) which some writers incorrectly
suppose was formerly called Arene, by the same name as the
Pylian city, and the promontory Platamodes, from which to
the Coryphasium, and to the place at present called Pylus, are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
100 stadia.<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> There is also a cenotaph and a small town in it
both of the same name&mdash;Prot&#275;.</p>

<p>We ought not perhaps to carry our inquiries so far into antiquity,
and it might be sufficient to describe the present state
of each place, if certain reports about them had not been delivered
down to us in childhood; but as different writers give
different accounts, it is necessary to examine them. The most
famous and the most ancient writers being the first in point
of personal knowledge of the places, are, in general, persons of
the most credit. Now as Homer surpasses all others in these
respects, we must examine what he says, and compare his
descriptions with the present state of places, as we have just
said. We have already considered his description of the
Hollow Elis and of Buprasium.</p>

<p>24. He describes the dominions of Nestor in these words:</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;And they who inhabited Pylus, and the beautiful Arene, and Thryum,
a passage across the Alpheius, and the well-built &AElig;py, and Cyparisseis,
and Amphigeneia, and Pteleum, and Helos, and Dorium, where the
Muses having met with Thamyris the Thracian, deprived him of the
power of song, as he was coming from &#338;chalia, from the house of Eurytus
the &#338;chalian.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a></p>

<p>It is Pylus, therefore, to which the question relates, and we
shall soon treat of it. We have already spoken of Arene.
The places, which he here calls Thryum, in another passage
he calls Thryoessa,</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">&#8220;There is a city Thryoessa, lofty, situated on a hill,</div>
<div class="line">Far off, on the banks of the Alpheius.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>He calls it the ford or passage of the Alpheius, because, according
to these verses, it seems as if it could be crossed at
this place on foot. Thryum is at present called Epitalium, a
village of Macistia.</p>

<p>With respect to &#949;&#8020;&#954;&#964;&#953;&#964;&#959;&#957; &#913;&#7990;&#960;&#965;], &#8220;&AElig;py the well-built,&#8221;
some writers ask which of these words is the epithet of the
other, and what is the city, and whether it is the present Margal&aelig;
of Amphidolia, but this Margal&aelig; is not a natural fortress,
but another is meant, a natural stronghold in Macistia.
Writers who suppose this place to be meant, say, that &AElig;py is
the name of the city, and infer it from its natural properties,
as in the example of Helos,<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> &AElig;gialos,<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> and many others:
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]<br />[CAS. 349]</a></span>
those who suppose Margal&aelig; to be meant here, will assert the
contrary.</p>

<p>Thryum, or Thryoessa, they say, is Epitalium, because all the
country is &#952;&#961;&#965;&#8061;&#948;&#951;&#962;, or sedgy, and particularly the banks of the
rivers, but this appears more clearly at the fordable places of
the stream. Perhaps Thryum is meant by the ford, and by
&#8220;the well-built &AElig;py,&#8221; Epitalium, which is naturally strong,
and in the other part of the passage he mentions a lofty hill;</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">&#8220;The city Thryoessa, a lofty hill,</div>
<div class="line">Far away by the Alpheus.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>25. Cyparisse&iuml;s is near the old Macistia, which then extended
even to the other side of the Neda, but it is not inhabited,
as neither is Macistum. There is also another, the
Messenian Cyparissia, not having quite the same name, but
one like it. The city of Macistia is at present called Cyparissia,
in the singular number, and feminine gender, but the
name of the river is Cyparisseis.</p>

<p>Amphigeneia, also belonging to Macistia, is near Hypsoeis,
where is the temple of Latona.</p>

<p>Pteleum was founded by the colony that came from Pteleum
in Thessaly, for it is mentioned in this line,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;Antron on the sea-coast, and the grassy Pteleum.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>It is a woody place, uninhabited, called Pteleasimum.</p>

<p>Some writers say, that Helos was some spot near the
Alpheius; others, that it was a city like that in Laconia,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;and Helos, a small city on the sea;&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>others say that it is the marsh near Alorium, where is a
temple of the Eleian Artemis, (Diana of the Marsh,) belonging
to the Arcadians, for this people had the priesthood.</p>

<p>Dorium is said by some authors to be a mountain, by others
a plain, but nothing is now to be seen; yet it is alleged, that
the present Oluris, or Olura, situated in the Aulon, as it is
called, of Messenia, is Dorium. Somewhere there also is
&#338;chalia of Eurytus, the present Andania, a small Arcadian
town of the same name as those in Thessaly and Eub&#339;a,
whence the poet says, Thamyris, the Thracian, came to Dorium,
and was deprived by the Muses of the power of song.</p>

<p>26. Hence it is evident that the country under the command
of Nestor is on each side of the Alpheius, all of which tract
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
he calls the country of the Pylians, but nowhere does the
Alpheius touch Messenia, nor the Hollow Elis.<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a></p>

<p>It is in this district that we have the native country of
Nestor, which we call the Triphylian, the Arcadian, and the
Lepreatic Pylus. For we know that other places of the name
of Pylus are pointed out, situated upon the sea, but this is
distant more than 30 stadia from it, as appears from the
poem. A messenger is sent to the vessel, to the companions
of Telemachus,&mdash;to invite them to a hospitable entertainment.
Telemachus, upon his return from Sparta, does not permit
Peisistratus to go to the city, but diverts him from it, and
prevails upon him to hasten to the ship, whence it appears
that the same road did not lead both to the city and to the
haven. The departure of Telemachus may in this manner
be aptly understood:</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;they went past Cruni, and the beautiful streams of Chalcis; the sun
set, and all the villages were in shade and darkness; but the ship, exulting
in the gales of Jove, arrived at Phe&aelig;. She passed also the divine
Elis, where the Epeii rule;&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a></p>

<p>for to this place the direction of the vessel was towards the
north, and thence it turns to the east. The vessel leaves its
first and straight course in the direction of Ithaca, because the
suitors had placed an ambush there,</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">&#8220;In the strait between Ithaca and Samos,</div>
<div class="line">And from thence he directed the vessel to the sharp-pointed islands, &#957;&#8053;&#963;&#959;&#953;&#963;&#953; &#952;&#959;&#8135;&#963;&#953;;&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>the sharp-pointed (&#8000;&#958;&#949;&#8055;&#945;&#953;) he calls &#952;&#959;&#945;&#8054;. They belong to the
Echinades, and are near the commencement of the Corinthian
Gulf and the mouths of the Achelous. After having sailed
past Ithaca so as to leave the island behind him, he turns to
the proper course between Acarnania and Ithaca, and disembarks
on the other side of the island, not at the strait of
Cephallenia, where the suitors were on the watch.</p>

<p>27. If any one therefore should suppose that the Eleian
Pylus is the Pylus of Nestor, the ship would not properly be
said, after setting off thence, to take its course along Cruni
and Chalcis, as far as the west, then to arrive by night at
Phe&aelig;, and afterwards to sail along the territory of Eleia, for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]<br />[CAS. 351]</a></span>
these places are to the south of Eleia, first Phe&aelig;, then Chalcis,
then Cruni, then the Triphylian Pylus, and the Samicum.
In sailing then to the south from the Eleian Pylus this would
be the course. In sailing to the north, where Ithaca lies, all
these places are left behind, but they must sail along Eleia
itself, and before, although he says after, sunset. Again, on
the other side, if any one should suppose the Messenian Pylus
and the Coryphasium to be the commencement of the voyage
after leaving the country of Nestor, the distance would be
great, and would occupy more time. For the distance only
to the Triphylian Pylus and the Samian Poseidium is 400
stadia, and the voyage would not be along Cruni, and Chalcis,
and Phe&aelig;, the names of obscure places and rivers, or rather
of streams, but first along the Neda, then Acidon, next
Alpheius, and the places and countries lying between these
rivers, and lastly, if we must mention them, along the former,
because the voyage was along the former places and rivers
also.</p>

<p>28. Besides, Nestor&#8217;s account of the war between the
Pylians and Eleians, which he relates to Patroclus, agrees
with our arguments, if any one examines the lines. For he
says there, that Hercules laid waste Pylus, and that all the
youth were exterminated; that out of twelve sons of Neleus,
he himself alone survived, and was a very young man, and
that the Epeii, despising Neleus on account of his old age
and destitute state, treated the Pylians with haughtiness and
insult. Nestor therefore, in order to avenge this wrong, collected
as large a body of his people as he was able, made an inroad
into Eleia, and carried away a large quantity of booty;</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>and as many flocks of goats, an hundred and fifty brood
mares, bay-coloured, most of which had foals, and &#8220;these,&#8221;
he says,</p>


<div class="poetry-container">

<p>so that the capture of the booty, and the flight of those who
came to the assistance of people who were robbed, happened
in the day-time, when, he says, he slew Itamon; and
they returned by night, so that they arrived by night at the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
city. When they were engaged in dividing the booty, and in
sacrificing, the Epeii, having assembled in multitudes, on the
third day marched against them with an army of horse and
foot, and encamped about Thryum, which is situated on the
Alpheius. The Pylians were no sooner informed of this than
they immediately set out to the relief of this place, and having
passed the night on the river Minyeius near Arene, thence
arrive at the Alpheius at noon. After sacrificing to the gods,
and passing the night on the banks of the river, they immediately,
in the morning, engaged in battle. The rout of the
enemy was complete, and they did not desist from the pursuit
and slaughter, till they came to Buprasium,</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;and the Olenian rock, where is a tumulus of Alesius, whence again
Minerva repulsed the multitudes;&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a></p>

</div></div></div>

<p>29. From these verses how can it be supposed that Eleian
or Messenian Pylus is meant. I say the Eleian, because when
this was destroyed by Hercules, the country of the Epeii also
was ravaged at the same time, that is, Eleia. How then could
those, who were of the same tribe, and who had been plundered
at that time, show such pride and insult to persons, who
were suffering under the same injuries? How could they
overrun and ravage their own country? How could Augeas
and Neleus be kings of the same people, and yet be mutual
enemies; for to Neleus</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;a great debt was owing at the divine Elis; four horses, which had won
the prize; they came with their chariots to contend for prizes; they were
about to run in the race for a tripod; and Augeas, king of men, detained
them there, but dismissed the charioteer.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a></p>

<p>If Neleus lived there, there Nestor also lived. How then
were there</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;four chiefs of Eleians and Buprasians, with ten swift ships accompanying
each, and with many Epeii embarked in them?&#8221;</p>

<p>The country also was divided into four parts, none of which
was subject to Nestor, but those tribes were under his command,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="line">
&#8220;who lived at Pylus, and the pleasant Ar&#275;n&#275;,&#8221;</div>

<p>and at the places that follow next as far as Messene.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]<br />[CAS. 352]</a></span>
How came the Epeii, when marching against the Pylians, to
set out towards the Alpheius and Thryum, and after being
defeated there in battle, to fly to Buprasium? But on the
other side, if Hercules laid waste the Messenian Pylus, how
could they, who were at such a distance, treat the Pylians
with insult, or have so much intercourse and traffic with
them, and defraud them by refusing to discharge a debt, so
that war should ensue on that account? How too could
Nestor, after having got, in his marauding adventure, so large
a quantity of booty, a prey of swine and sheep, none of which
are swift-footed, nor able to go a long journey, accomplish a
march of more than 1000 stadia to Pylus near Coryphasium?
Yet all the Epeii arrive at Thryoessa and the river Alpheius
on the third day, ready to lay siege to the stronghold. How
also did these districts belong to the chiefs of Messenia, when
the Caucones, and Triphylii, and Pisat&aelig; occupied them?
But the territory Gerena, or Gerenia, for it is written both
ways, might have a name which some persons applied designedly,
or which might have originated even in accident.</p>

<p>Since, however, Messenia was entirely under the dominion
of Menelaus, to whom Laconia also was subject, as will be
evident from what will be said hereafter, and since the rivers,
the Pamisus and the Nedon, flow through this country, and
not the Alpheius at all, which runs in a straight line through
the country of the Pylians, of which Nestor was ruler, can
that account be credible, by which it appears that one man
takes possession by force of the dominion of another, and
deprives him of the cities, which are said to be his property
in the Catalogue of the Ships, and makes others subject to
the usurper.</p>

<p>30. It remains that we speak of Olympia, and of the
manner in which everything fell into the power of the Eleii.</p>

<p>The temple is in the district Pisatis, at the distance of less
than 300 stadia from Elis. In front of it is a grove of wild
olive trees, where is the stadium. The Alpheius flows beside
it, taking its course out of Arcadia to the Triphylian Sea
between the west and the south. The fame of the temple
was originally owing to the oracle of the Olympian Jove;
yet after that had ceased, the renown of the temple continued,
and increased, as we know, to a high degree of celebrity,
both on account of the assembly of the people of Greece,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
which was held there, and of the Olympic games, in which
the victor was crowned. These games were esteemed sacred,
and ranked above all others. The temple was decorated
with abundance of offerings, the contributions of all Greece.
Among these offerings was a Jupiter of beaten gold, presented
by Cypselus, the tyrant of Corinth. The largest was a
statue of Jupiter in ivory, the workmanship of Phidias of
Athens, the son of Charmides. Its height was so great, that
although the temple is very large, the artist seems to have
mistaken its proportions, and although he made the figure
sitting, yet the head nearly touches the roof, and presents the
appearance that, if it should rise, and stand upright, it would
unroof the temple. Some writers have given the measurement
of the statue, and Callimachus has expressed it in some
iambic verses. Pan&aelig;nus, the painter, his nephew, and joint
labourer, afforded great assistance in the completion of the
statue with respect to the colours with which it was ornamented,
and particularly the drapery.</p>

<p>There are exhibited also many and admirable pictures
around the temple, the work of this painter. It is recorded
of Phidias, that to Pan&aelig;nus, who was inquiring after what
model he intended to form the figure of Jupiter, he replied,
that it would be from that of Homer delineated in these words;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;He spoke, and gave the nod with his sable brows, the ambrosial hair
shook on the immortal head of the king of gods, and vast Olympus
trembled.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a></p>

<p>[This is well expressed, and the poet, as from other circumstances,
so particularly from the brows, suggests the thought
that he is depicting some grand conception, and great power
worthy of Jupiter. So also in his description of Juno, in
both he preserves the peculiar decorum of each character, for
he says,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;she moved herself upon the throne, and shook vast Olympus:&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>this was effected by the motion of her whole body, but
Olympus shakes when Jupiter only nods with his brows, the
hair of his head partaking of the motion. It was elegantly
said [of Homer] that he was the only person who had
seen and had made visible the figures of the gods.]<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]<br />[CAS. 354]</a></span></p>

<p>To the Eleii above all other people is to be ascribed the
magnificence of the temple at Olympia, and the reverence in
which it was held. For about the Trojan times, and even
before that period, they were not in a flourishing state, having
been reduced to a low condition by war with the Pylii, and
afterwards by Hercules, when Augeas their king was overthrown.
The proof is this. The Eleii sent forty ships to
Troy, but the Pylians and Nestor ninety; then after the
return of the Heracleid&aelig; the contrary happened. For the
&AElig;toli returning with the Heracleid&aelig; under the command of
Oxylus, became joint settlers with the Epeii, on the ground of
ancient affinity. They extended the bounds of Hollow Elis,
got possession of a large portion of the Pisatis, and subjected
Olympia to their power. It was these people who invented
the Olympic games,<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> and instituted the first Olympiad. For
we must reject the ancient stories both respecting the foundation
of the temple, and the establishment of the games, some
alleging that Hercules, one of the Id&aelig;an Dactyli, was the
founder; others, that the son of Alcmene and Jupiter founded
them, who also was the first combatant and victor. For such
things are variously reported, and not entitled to much credit.
It is more probable, that from the first Olympiad,<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a> when
Cor&#339;bus the Eleian was the victor in the race in the stadium,
to the twenty-sixth, the Eleians presided over the temple, and
at the games. But in the Trojan times, either there were no
games where a crown was awarded, or they had not yet acquired
any fame, neither these nor any of the games which
are now so renowned. Homer does not speak of these games,
but of others of a different kind, which were celebrated at
funerals. Some persons however are of opinion that he does
mention the Olympic games, when he says, that Augeas detained
four victorious horses, which had been sent to contend
for the prize. It is also said that the Pisat&aelig; did not take any
part in the Trojan war, being considered as consecrated to the
service of Jupiter. But neither was the Pisatis, the tract of
country in which Olympia is situated, subject at that time to
Augeas, but Eleia only, nor were the Olympic games celebrated
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
even once in the Eleian district, but always at Olympia.
But the games, of which Homer speaks, seem to have taken
place in Elis, where the debt was owing,</p>



<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">&#8220;For a great debt was owing in the divine Elis,</div>
<div class="line">Namely, four victorious horses.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But it was not in these, but in the Olympic games, that the
victor was crowned, for here they were to contend for a tripod.</p>

<p>After the twenty-sixth Olympiad, the Pisat&aelig;, having recovered
their territory, instituted games themselves, when
they perceived that these games were obtaining celebrity. But
in after-times, when the territory of the Pisatis reverted to the
Eleii, the presidency and celebration of the games reverted
to them also. The Laced&aelig;monians too, after the last defeat of
the Messenians, co-operated with the Eleii as allies, contrary
to the conduct of the descendants of Nestor and of the Arcadians,
who were allies of the Messenians. And they assisted
them so effectually that all the country as far as Messene was
called Eleia, and the name continues even to the present time.
But of the Pisat&aelig;, and Triphylii, and Caucones, not even the
names remain. They united also Pylus Emathoeis itself with
Lepreum in order to gratify the Lepreat&aelig;, who had taken no
part in the war. They razed many other towns, and imposed
a tribute upon as many as were inclined to maintain their independence.</p>

<p>31. The Pisatis obtained the highest celebrity from the
great power of its sovereigns, &#338;nomaus and his successor
Pelops, and the number of their children. Salmoneus is said
to have reigned there, and one of the eight cities, into which
the Pisatis is divided, has the name of Salmone. For these
reasons, and on account of the temple at Olympia, the fame
of the country spread everywhere.</p>

<p>We must however receive ancient histories, as not entirely
agreeing with one another, for modern writers, entertaining
different opinions, are accustomed to contradict them frequently;
as for example, according to some writers, Augeas
was king of the Pisatis, and &#338;nomaus and Salmoneus kings
of Eleia, while others consider the two nations as one. Still
we ought to follow in general what is received as true, since
writers are not agreed even upon the derivation of the word
Pisatis. Some derive it from Pisa, (&#928;&#8150;&#963;&#945;) a city of the same
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]<br />[CAS. 356]</a></span>
name as the fountain, and say that the fountain had that name,
as much as to say Pistra, (&#928;&#8055;&#963;&#964;&#961;&#945;) which means Potistra,
(&#960;&#959;&#964;&#8055;&#963;&#964;&#961;&#945;,) or &#8220;potable.&#8221; The city of Pisa is shown, situated
on an eminence between two mountains, which have the same
names as those in Thessaly, Ossa and Olympus. Some say,
that there was no such city as Pisa, for it would have been
one of the eight, but a fountain only, which is now called
Bisa, near Cicysium, the largest of the eight cities. But
Stesichorus calls the tract of country named Pisa, a city, as
the poet calls Lesbos, a city of Macar; and Euripides in the
play of Ion says</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">&#8220;Eub&#339;a is a neighbour city to Athens,&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>and so in the play of Rhadamanthus,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="line">&#8220;they who occupy the land of Eub&#339;a, an adjoining state;&#8221;</div>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">&#8220;O stranger, all this country is called Asia,</div>
<div class="line">But the state of the Mysi is called Mysia.&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>32. Salmon&#275; is near the fountain of the same name, the
source of the Enipeus. It discharges itself into the Alpheius,
[and at present it is called Barnichius.<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a>] Tyro, it is said,
was enamoured of this river;</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>for there her father Salmoneus was king, as Euripides says in
the play of &AElig;olus. [The river in Thessaly some call Eniseus,
which, flowing from the Othrys, receives the Apidanus, that
descends from the mountain Pharsalus.<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a>] Near Salmon&#275; is
Heracleia, which is one of the eight cities, distant about 40
stadia from Olympia on the river Cytherius, where there is
a temple of the nymphs, the Ioniades, who are believed to
heal diseases by means of the waters of the river.</p>

<p>Near Olympia is Arp&#299;na, which also is one of the eight
cities. The river Parthenius runs through it in the direction
of the road to Pher&aelig;a. Pher&aelig;a belongs to Arcadia. [It is
situated above Dym&aelig;a, Buprasium, and Elis, which lie to the
north of the Pisatis.<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a>] There also is Cicysium, one of the
eight cities; and Dyspontium, on the road from Elis to
Olympia, situated in a plain. But it was razed, and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
greatest part of the inhabitants removed to Epidamnus and
Apollonia.</p>

<p>Above and so very near Olympia, is Pholoe, an Arcadian
mountain, that the country at its foot belongs to the Pisatis.
Indeed the whole of the Pisatis and a great part of Triphylia
border upon Arcadia. For this reason, most of the places, which
have the name of Pylian in the Catalogue of the Ships, seem to
be Arcadian. Persons, however, who are well informed, say,
that the river Erymanthus, one of those that empty themselves
into the Alpheius, is the boundary of Arcadia, and that
the places called Pylian are beyond the Erymanthus.</p>

<p>33. According to Ephorus, &#8220;&AElig;tolus, being banished by
Salmoneus, king of the Epeii, and the Pisat&aelig;, from Eleia to
&AElig;tolia, called the country after his own name, and settled
the cities there. His descendant Oxylus was the friend of
Temenus, and the Heracleid&aelig; his companions, and was their
guide on their journey to Peloponnesus; he divided among
them the hostile territory, and suggested instructions relative
to the acquisition of the country. In return for these services
he was to be requited by the restoration of Elis, which had belonged
to his ancestors. He returned with an army collected
out of &AElig;tolia, for the purpose of attacking the Epeii, who
occupied Elis. On the approach of the Epeii in arms, when the
forces were drawn up in array against each other, there advanced
in front, and engaged in single combat according to an
ancient custom of the Greeks, Pyr&aelig;chmes, an &AElig;tolian, and
Degmenus, an Epeian: the latter was lightly armed with a
bow, and thought to vanquish easily from a distance a heavy-armed
soldier; the former, when he perceived the stratagem
of his adversary, provided himself with a sling, and a scrip
filled with stones. The kind of sling also happened to have
been lately invented by the &AElig;tolians. As a sling reaches its
object at a greater distance than a bow, Degmenus fell; the
&AElig;tolians took possession of the country, and ejected the Epeii.
They assumed also the superintendence of the temple at
Olympia, which the Epeii exercised; and on account of the
friendship which subsisted between Oxylus and the Heracleid&aelig;,
it was generally agreed upon, and confirmed by an oath, that
the Eleian territory was sacred to Jupiter, and that any one
who invaded that country with an army, was a sacrilegious
person: he also was to be accounted sacrilegious, who did not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]<br />[CAS. 358]</a></span>
defend it against the invader to the utmost of his power. It
was for this reason, that the later founders of the city left it
without walls, and those who are passing through the country
with an army, deliver up their arms and receive them again
upon quitting the borders. Iphitus instituted there the
Olympic games, because the Eleians were a sacred people.
Hence it was that they increased in numbers, for while other
nations were continually engaged in war with each other, they
alone enjoyed profound peace, and not themselves only, but
strangers also, so that on this account they were a more
populous state than all the others.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pheidon the Argive was the tenth in descent from Temenus,
and the most powerful prince of his age; he was the inventor of
the weights and measures called Pheidonian, and stamped
money, silver in particular. He recovered the whole inheritance
of Temenus, which had been severed into many portions.
He attacked also the cities which Hercules had formerly taken,
and claimed the privilege of celebrating the games which
Hercules had established, and among these the Olympian
games. He entered their country by force and celebrated the
games, for the Eleians had no army to prevent it, as they were
in a state of peace, and the rest were oppressed by his power.
The Eleians however did not solemnly inscribe in their records
this celebration of the games, but on this occasion procured
arms, and began to defend themselves. The Laced&aelig;monians
also afforded assistance, either because they were jealous of the
prosperity, which was the effect of the peaceful state of the
Eleians, or because they supposed that they should have the
aid of the Eleians in destroying the power of Pheidon, who
had deprived them of the sovereignty &#7969;&#947;&#949;&#956;&#959;&#957;&#8055;&#945;&#957; of Peloponnesus,
which they before possessed. They succeeded in
their joint attempt to overthrow Pheidon, and the Eleians
with this assistance obtained possession of Pisatis and Triphylia.</p>

<p>The whole of the coasting voyage along the present Eleian
territory comprises, with the exception of the bays, 1200
stadia.</p>

<p>So much then respecting the Eleian territory.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Messenia</span> is continuous with the Eleian territory, inclining
for the most part towards the south, and the Libyan Sea.
Being part of Laconia, it was subject in the Trojan times to
Menelaus. The name of the country was Messene. But the
present city called Messene, the acropolis of which was Ithome,
was not then founded. After the death of Menelaus, when
the power of those who succeeded to the possession of Laconia
was altogether weakened, the Neleid&aelig; governed Messenia.
At the time of the return of the Heracleid&aelig;, and according
to the partition of the country at that time, Melanthus was
king of the Messenians, who were a separate community, but
formerly subject to Menelaus. As a proof of this, in the
space from the Messenian Gulf and the continuous gulf, (called
the Asin&aelig;an from the Messenian Asine,) were situated the
seven cities which Agamemnon promised to Achilles;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;Cardamyle, Enope, the grassy Hira, the divine Pher&aelig;,<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a> Antheia with
rich meadows, the beautiful &AElig;peia, and Pedasus abounding with vines.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a></p>

<p>He certainly would not have promised what did not belong
either to himself or to his brother. The poet mentions those,
who accompanied Menelaus from Pher&aelig; to the war,<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a> and speaks
of (&#338;tylus) in the Laconian catalogue, a city situated on the
Gulf of Messenia.</p>

<p>Messene follows next to Triphylia. The promontory, after
which are the Coryphasium and Cyparissia, is common to
both. At the distance of 7 stadia is a mountain, the &AElig;galeum,
situated above Coryphasium and the sea.</p>

<p>2. The ancient Messenian Pylus was a city lying below
the &AElig;galeum, and after it was razed, some of the inhabitants
settled under the Coryphasium. But the Athenians
in their second expedition against Sicily, under the command
of Eurymedon and Stratocles, got possession of it, and used
it as a stronghold against the Laced&aelig;monians.<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a> Here also
is the Messenian Cyparissia, (and the island Prote,) lying close
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]<br />[CAS. 359]</a></span>
to Pylus, the island Sphagia, called also Sphacteria. It was
here that the Laced&aelig;monians lost three hundred men,<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a> who
were besieged by the Athenians and taken prisoners.</p>

<p>Two islands, called Strophades,<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a> belonging to the Cyparissii,
lie off at sea in front of this coast, at the distance of
about 400 stadia from the continent, in the Libyan and southern
sea. According to Thucydides this Pylus was the naval
station of the Messenians. It is distant from Sparta 400 stadia.</p>

<p>3. Next is Methone.<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a> This city, called by the poet Pedasus,
was one of the seven, it is said, which Agamemnon promised
to Achilles. There Agrippa killed, in the Actian war,
Bogus, the king of the Maurusii, a partisan of Antony&#8217;s,
having got possession of the place by an attack by sea.</p>

<p>4. Continuous with Methone is Acritas,<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> where the Messenian
Gulf begins, which they call also Asin&aelig;us from Asine, a
small city, the first we meet with on the gulf, and having the
same name as the Hermionic Asine.</p>

<p>This is the commencement of the gulf towards the west.
Towards the east are the Thyrides,<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a> as they are called, bordering
upon the present Laconia near C&aelig;nepolis,<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a> and T&aelig;narum.</p>

<p>In the intervening distance, if we begin from the Thyrides,
we meet with &#338;tylus,<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a> by some called Beitylus; then Leuctrum,
a colony of the Leuctri in B&#339;otia; next, situated upon
a steep rock, Cardamyle;<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a> then Pher&aelig;, bordering upon Thuria,
and Gerenia, from which place they say Nestor had the
epithet Gerenian, because he escaped thither, as we have
mentioned before. They show in the Gerenian territory a
temple of &AElig;sculapius Tricc&aelig;us, copied from that at the Thessalian
Tricca. Pelops is said to have founded Leuctrum, and
Charadra, and Thalami, now called the B&#339;otian Thalami,
having brought with him, when he married his sister Niobe
to Amphion, some colonists from B&#339;otia.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>The Nedon, a different river from the Neda, flows through
Laconia, and discharges its waters near Pher&aelig;. It has upon
its banks a remarkable temple of the Nedusian Minerva. At
P&#339;aessa also there is a temple of the Nedusian Minerva,
which derives its name from a place called Nedon,<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a> whence,
they say, Teleclus colonized P&#339;aessa,<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a> and Echei&aelig;, and
Tragium.</p>

<p>5. With respect to the seven cities promised to Achilles, we
have already spoken of Cardamyle, and Pher&aelig;, and Pedasus.
Enope, some say is Pellana; others, some place near Cardamyle;
others, Gerenia.<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a> Hira is pointed out near a mountain
in the neighbourhood of Megalopolis<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a> in Arcadia, on the road
to Andania, which we have said is called by the poet &#338;chalia.
Others say that the present Mesola was called Hira,
which extends to the bay situated between Ta&yuml;getum and
Messenia. &AElig;peia is now called Thuria, which we said bordered
upon Pher&aelig;. It is situated upon a lofty hill, whence
its name.<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a> The Thuriatic Gulf has its name from Thuria;
upon the gulf is a single city, named Rhium, opposite T&aelig;narum.
Some say that Antheia is Thuria, and &AElig;peia Methone;
others, that Antheia is Asine, situated between Methone and
Thuria, to which, of all the Messenian cities, the description,
&#8220;with its rich pastures,&#8221; is most appropriate. Near it on the sea
is Corone. There are some writers who say that this town is
called Pedasus by the poet. These cities are &#8220;all near the
sea;&#8221; Cardamyle close to it; Pher&aelig; at the distance of 5
stadia, having an anchorage, which is used in the summer.
The rest are situated at unequal distances from the sea.</p>

<p>6. Near Corone, about the middle of the gulf, the river
Pamisus<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a> discharges itself, having, on the right hand, this
city, and the rest in succession, the last of which, towards the
west, are Pylus and Cyparissia, and between these is Erana,
which some writers erroneously suppose to be the ancient
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]<br />[CAS. 361]</a></span>
Arene; on the left hand it has Thyria and Pher&aelig;. It is the
largest (in width) of the rivers within the isthmus, although
its course from its springs does not exceed 100 stadia in
length; it has an abundant supply of water, and traverses the
Messenian plain, and the district called Macaria.<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a> It is distant
from the present city of the Messenians 50 stadia.<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a> There
is also another Pamisus, a small torrent stream, running near
Leuctrum of Laconia, which was a subject of dispute between
the Messenians and Laced&aelig;monians in the time of Philip.</p>

<p>I have before said that some persons called the Pamisus,
Amathus.<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a></p>

<p>7. Ephorus relates that Cresphontes, after he had taken Messene,
divided it into five cities, and chose Stenyclarus, situated
in the middle of this district, to be the royal seat of his kingdom.
To the other cities, Pylus, Rhium, (Mesola,) and
Hyameitis, he appointed kings, and put all the Messenians on
an equal footing with the Dorians as to rights and privileges.
The Dorians, however, taking offence, he changed his intention,
and determined that Stenyclarus alone should have the
rank of a city, and here he assembled all the Dorians.</p>

<p>8. The city of the Messenians<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a> resembles Corinth, for above
each city is a lofty and precipitous mountain, enclosed by a
common wall in such a manner as to be used as an acropolis;
the Messenian mountain is Ithome,<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a> that near Corinth is
Acrocorinthus. Demetrius of Pharos seemed to have counselled
Philip the son of Demetrius well, when he advised him
to make himself master of both cities, if he desired to get
possession of Peloponnesus; &#8220;for,&#8221; said he, &#8220;when you have
seized both horns, the cow will be your own;&#8221; meaning, by
the horns, Ithome and Acrocorinthus, and, by the cow, Peloponnesus.
It was no doubt their convenient situation which
made these cities subjects of contention. The Romans therefore
razed Corinth, and again rebuilt it. The Laced&aelig;monians
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
destroyed Messene, and the Thebans, and subsequently Philip,
the son of Amyntas, restored it. The citadels however continued
unoccupied.</p>

<p>9. The temple of Diana in Limn&aelig; (in the Marshes), where
the Messenians are supposed to have violated the virgins who
came there to offer sacrifice, is on the confines of Laconia and
Messenia, where the inhabitants of both countries usually celebrated
a common festival, and performed sacrifices; but after
the violation of the virgins, the Messenians did not make any
reparation, and war, it is said, ensued. The Limn&aelig;an temple of
Diana at Sparta is said to have its name from the Limn&aelig; here.</p>

<p>10. There were frequent wars (between the Laced&aelig;monians
and Messenians) on account of the revolts of the Messenians.
Tyrt&aelig;us mentions, in his poems, that their first subjugation
was in the time of their grandfathers;<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a> the second, when in
conjunction with their allies the Eleians [Arcadians], Argives,
and Pisat&aelig;, they revolted; the leader of the Arcadians
was Aristocrates, king of Orchomenus, and of the Pisat&aelig;,
Pantaleon, son of Omphalion. In this war, Tyrt&aelig;us says, he
himself commanded the Laced&aelig;monian army, for in his elegiac
poem, entitled Eunomia, he says he came from Erineum;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;for Jupiter himself, the son of Saturn, and husband of Juno with the
beautiful crown, gave this city to the Heracleid&aelig;, with whom we left the
windy Erineum, and arrived at the spacious island of Pelops.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wherefore we must either invalidate the authority of the
elegiac verses, or we must disbelieve Philochorus, and Callisthenes,
and many other writers, who say that he came from
Athens, or Aphidn&aelig;, at the request of the Laced&aelig;monians,
whom an oracle had enjoined to receive a commander from
the Athenians.</p>

<p>The second war then occurred in the time of Tyrt&aelig;us.
But they mention a third, and even a fourth war, in which the
Messenians were destroyed.<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]<br />[CAS. 362]</a></span></p>

<p>The whole voyage along the Messenian coast comprises
about 800 stadia, including the measurement of the bays.</p>

<p>11. I have exceeded the limits of moderation in this description,
by attending to the multitude of facts which are related
of a country, the greatest part of which is deserted.
Even Laconia itself is deficient in population, if we compare
its present state with its ancient populousness. For, with the
exception of Sparta, the remaining small cities are about
thirty; but, anciently, Laconia had the name of Hecatompolis,
and that for this reason hecatombs were annually sacrificed.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<p><a name="viii_v_1" id="viii_v_1"></a>1. <span class="smcap">Next</span> after the Messenian is the Laconian Gulf, situated
between T&aelig;narum and Male&aelig;, declining a little from the
south to the east. Thyrides, a precipitous rock, beaten by
the waves, is in the Messenian Gulf, and distant from T&aelig;narum
100 stadia. Above is Ta&yuml;getum, a lofty and perpendicular
mountain, at a short distance from the sea, approaching
on the northern side close to the Arcadian mountains, so as to
leave between them a valley, where Messenia is continuous
with Laconia.</p>

<p>At the foot of Ta&yuml;getum, in the inland parts, lie Sparta
and Amycl&aelig;,<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a> where is the temple of Apollo, and Pharis. The
site of Sparta is in rather a hollow, although it comprises
mountains within it; no part of it, however, is marshy,
although, anciently, the suburbs were so, which were called
Limn&aelig;. The temple of Bacchus, also in Limn&aelig;, was in a wet
situation, but now stands on a dry ground.</p>

<p>In the bay on the coast is T&aelig;narum, a promontory projecting
into the sea.<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a> Upon it, in a grove, is the temple of
Neptune, and near the temple a cave, through which, according
to the fable, Cerberus was brought up by Hercules from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
Hades. Thence to the promontory Phycus in Cyrenaica, is
a passage across towards the south of 3000 stadia; and to
Pachynus, towards the west, the promontory of Sicily, 4600,
or, according to some writers, 4000 stadia; to Male&aelig;, towards
the east, including the measurement of the bays, 670 stadia;
to Onugnathus,<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a> a low peninsula a little within Male&aelig;, 520
stadia. (In front of Onugnathus, at the distance of 40 stadia,
lies Cythera,<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a> an island with a good harbour, and a city of the
same name, which was the private property of Eurycles, the
commander of the Laced&aelig;monians in our time. It is surrounded
by several small islands, some near it, others lying
somewhat farther off.) To Corycus, a promontory of Crete,
the nearest passage by sea is 250 stadia.<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a></p>

<p>2. Next to T&aelig;narum on the voyage to Onugnathus and to
Male&aelig;<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a> is Amathus, (Psamathus,) a city; then follow Asine,
and Gythium,<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a> the naval arsenal of Sparta, situated at an interval
of 240 stadia. Its station for vessels, they say, is excavated
by art. Farther on, between Gythium and Acr&aelig;a, is
the mouth of the Eurotas.<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a> To this place the voyage along the
coast is about 240 stadia; then succeeds a marshy tract, and
a village, Helos, which formerly was a city, according to Homer;</p>


<p class="small">
&#8220;They who occupied Amycl&aelig;, and Helos, a small town on the sea-coast.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a>
</p>

<p>They say that it was founded by Helius the son of Perseus.
There is a plain also call Leuce; then Cyparissia,<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a> a city
upon a peninsula, with a harbour; then Onugnathus with
a harbour; next B&#339;a, a city; then Male&aelig;. From these
cities to Onugnathus are 150 stadia. There is also Asopus,<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a>
a city in Laconia.</p>

<p>3. Among the places enumerated by Homer in the Catalogue
of the Ships, Messa, they say, is no longer to be found;
and that Messoa is not a part of Laconia, but a part of Sparta
itself, as was the Limn&aelig;um near Thornax. Some understand
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]<br />[CAS. 364]</a></span>
Mess&#275; to be a contraction of Messene, for it is said that this
was a part of Laconia. [They allege as examples from the
poet, the words &#8220;cri,&#8221; and &#8220;do,&#8221; and &#8220;maps,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a> and this passage

<p>Of the rest of the places mentioned by the poet, some are
extinct; of others traces remain, and of others the names are
changed, as Augei&aelig; into &AElig;g&aelig;&aelig;: [the city] of that name in
Locris exists no longer. With respect to Las, the Dioscuri
are said to have taken it by siege formerly, whence they had
the name of Lapers&aelig;, (Destroyers of Las,) and Sophocles says
somewhere, &#8220;by the two Lapers&aelig;, by Eurotas, by the gods
in Argos and Sparta.&#8221;</p>

<p>4. Ephorus says that the Heracleid&aelig;, Eurysthenes and
Procles, having obtained possession of Laconia, divided it into
six parts, and founded cities throughout the country, and assigned
Amycl&aelig; to him who betrayed to them Laconia, and
who prevailed upon the person that occupied it to retire, on
certain conditions, with the Ach&aelig;i, into Ionia. Sparta they retained
themselves as the royal seat of the kingdom. To the
other cities they sent kings, permitting them to receive whatever
strangers might be disposed to settle there, on account of
the scarcity of inhabitants. Las was used as a naval station,
because it had a convenient harbour; &AElig;gys, as a stronghold,
from whence to attack surrounding enemies; Pher&aelig;a, as a
place to deposit treasure, because it afforded security from<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a> attempts
from without. * * * * that all the neighbouring
people submitted to the Spartiat&aelig;, but were to enjoy an
equality of rights, and to have a share in the government and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
in the offices of state. They were called Heilot&aelig;. But Agis,
the son of Eurysthenes, deprived them of the equality of
rights, and ordered them to pay tribute to Sparta. The rest
submitted; but the Heleii, who occupied Helos, revolted, and
were made prisoners in the course of the war; they were adjudged
to be slaves, with the conditions, that the owner should
not be allowed to give them their liberty, nor sell them beyond
the boundaries of the country. This was called the war
of the Heilot&aelig;.<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a> The system of Heilote-slavery, which continued
from that time to the establishment of the dominion of
the Romans, was almost entirely the contrivance of Agis.
They were a kind of public slaves, to whom the Laced&aelig;monians
assigned habitations, and required from them peculiar
services.</p>

<p>5. With respect to the government of the Lacones, and the
changes which have taken place among them, many things,
as being well known, may be passed over, but some it may be
worth while to relate. It is said that the Ach&aelig;an Phthiot&aelig;,
who, with Pelops, made an irruption into Peloponnesus, settled
in Laconia, and were so much distinguished for their valour,
that Peloponnesus, which for a long period up to this time
had the name of Argos, was then called Ach&aelig;an Argos; and
not Peloponnesus alone had this name, but Laconia also was
thus peculiarly designated. Some even understand the words
of the poet,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;Where was Menelaus, was he not at Ach&aelig;an Argos?&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>as implying, was he not in Laconia? But about the time of
the return of the Heracleid&aelig;, when Philonomus betrayed the
country to the Dorians, they removed from Laconia to the
country of the Ionians, which at present is called Achaia. We
shall speak of them in our description of Achaia.</p>

<p>Those who were in possession of Laconia, at first conducted
themselves with moderation, but after they had intrusted to
Lycurgus the formation of a political constitution, they acquired
such a superiority over the other Greeks, that they
alone obtained the sovereignty both by sea and land, and continued
to be the chiefs of the Greeks, till the Thebans, and
soon afterwards the Macedonians, deprived them of this ascendency.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]<br />[CAS. 365]</a></span></p>

<p>They did not however entirely submit even to these, but,
preserving their independence, were continually disputing the
sovereignty both with the other Greeks and with the Macedonian
kings. After the overthrow of the latter by the
Romans, the Lacones living under a bad government at that
time, and under the power of tyrants, had given some slight
offence to the generals whom the Romans sent into the province.
They however recovered themselves, and were held
in very great honour. They remained free, and performed no
other services but those expected from allies. Lately however
Eurycles<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a> excited some disturbances amongst them, having
abused excessively, in the exercise of his authority, the friendship
of C&aelig;sar. The government soon came to an end by the
death of Eurycles, and the son rejected all such friendships.
The Eleuthero-Lacones<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a> however did obtain some regular
form of government, when the surrounding people, and especially
the Heilot&aelig;, at the time that Sparta was governed by
tyrants, were the first to attach themselves to the Romans.</p>

<p>Hellanicus says that Eurysthenes and Procles regulated the
form of government, but Ephorus reproaches him with not
mentioning Lycurgus at all, and with ascribing the acts of the
latter to persons who had no concern in them; to Lycurgus
only is a temple erected, and sacrifices are annually performed
in his honour, but to Eurysthenes and Procles, although they
were the founders of Sparta, yet not even these honours were
paid to them, that their descendants should bear the respective
appellations of Eurysthenid&aelig; and Procleid&aelig;.<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a> [The descendants
of Agis, however, the son of Eurysthenes, were called
Agides, and the descendants of Eurypon, the son of Procles,
were called Eurypontiad&aelig;. The former were legitimate
princes; the others, having admitted strangers as settlers,
reigned by their means; whence they were not regarded as
original authors of the settlement, an honour usually conferred
upon all founders of cities.]</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>6. As to the nature of the places in Laconia and Messenia,
we may take the description of Euripides;<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a></p>

<p class="small">&#8220;Laconia has much land capable of tillage, but difficult to be worked,
for it is hollow, surrounded by mountains, rugged, and difficult of access
to an enemy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Messenia he describes in this manner:</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;It bears excellent fruit; is watered by innumerable streams; it affords
the finest pasture to herds and flocks; it is not subject to the blasts of
winter, nor too much heated by the coursers of the sun;&#8221;</p>

<p>and a little farther on, speaking of the division of the country
by the Heracleid&aelig; according to lot, the first was</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;lord of the Lac&aelig;nian land, a bad soil,&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>the second was Messene,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;whose excellence no language could express;&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>and Tyrt&aelig;us speaks of it in the same manner.</p>

<p>But we cannot admit that Laconia and Messenia are
bounded, as Euripides says,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;by the Pamisus,<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a> which empties itself into the sea;&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>this river flows through the middle of Messenia, and does not
touch any part of the present Laconia. Nor is he right, when
he says that Messenia is inaccessible to sailors, whereas it
borders upon the sea, in the same manner as Laconia.</p>

<p>Nor does he give the right boundaries of Elis;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;after passing the river is Elis, the neighbour of Jove;&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>and he adduces a proof unnecessarily. For if he means the
present Eleian territory, which is on the confines of Messenia,
this the Pamisus does not touch, any more than it touches Laconia,
for, as has been said before, it flows through the middle
of Messenia: or, if he meant the ancient Eleia, called the Hollow,
this is a still greater deviation from the truth. For after
crossing the Pamisus, there is a large tract of the Messenian
country, then the whole district of [the Lepreat&aelig;], and of the
[Macistii], which is called Triphylia; then the Pisatis, and
Olympia; then at the distance of 300 stadia is Elis.</p>

<p>7. As some persons write the epithet applied by Homer to
Laced&aelig;mon, &#954;&#951;&#964;&#8061;&#949;&#963;&#963;&#945;&#957;, and others &#954;&#945;&#953;&#949;&#964;&#8049;&#949;&#963;&#963;&#945;&#957;, how are we to
understand &#954;&#951;&#964;&#8061;&#949;&#963;&#963;&#945;, whether it is derived from Cetos,<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a> or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]<br />[CAS. 367]</a></span>
whether it denotes &#8220;large,&#8221; which is most probable. Some
understand &#954;&#945;&#953;&#949;&#964;&#8049;&#949;&#963;&#963;&#945; to signify, &#8220;abounding with calaminthus;&#8221;
others suppose, as the fissures occasioned by earthquakes
are called C&aelig;eti, that this is the origin of the epithet.
Hence C&aelig;ietas also, the name of the prison among the Laced&aelig;monians,
which is a sort of cave. Some however say, that
such kind of hollows are rather called Coi, whence the expression
of Homer,<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a> applied to wild beasts, &#966;&#951;&#961;&#963;&#8054;&#957; &#8000;&#961;&#949;&#963;&#954;&#8180;&#959;&#953;&#963;&#953;&#957;,
which live in mountain caves. Laconia however is subject to
earthquakes, and some writers relate, that certain peaks of
Ta&yuml;getum have been broken off by the shocks.<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">148</a></p>

<p>Laconia contains also quarries of valuable marble. Those
of the T&aelig;narian marble in T&aelig;narum<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a> are ancient, and certain
persons, assisted by the wealth of the Romans, lately opened a
large quarry in Ta&yuml;getum.</p>

<p>8. It appears from Homer, that both the country and the
city had the name of Laced&aelig;mon; I mean the country together
with Messenia. When he speaks of the bow and
quiver of Ulysses, he says,</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;A present from Iphitus Eurytides, a stranger, who met him in Laced&aelig;mon,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a></p>

<p>and adds,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">&#8220;They met at Messene in the house of Ortilochus.&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>He means the country which was a part of Messenia.<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a> There
was then no difference whether he said &#8220;A stranger, whom he
met at Laced&aelig;mon, gave him,&#8221; or, &#8220;they met at Messene;&#8221;
for it is evident that Pher&aelig; was the home of Ortilochus:</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;they arrived at Pher&aelig;, and went to the house of Diocles the son of Ortilochus,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a></p>

<p>namely, Telemachus and Pisistratus. Now Pher&aelig;<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a> belongs to
Messenia. But after saying, that Telemachus and his friend
set out from Pher&aelig;, and were driving their two horses the
whole day, he adds,</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]<br />[CAS. 368]</a></span></p>

<p class="small">&#8220;The sun was setting; they came to the hollow Laced&aelig;mon (&#954;&#951;&#964;&#8061;&#949;&#963;&#963;&#945;&#957;),
and drove their chariot to the palace of Menelaus.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">154</a></p>

<p>Here we must understand the city; and if we do not, the poet
says, that they journeyed from Laced&aelig;mon to Laced&aelig;mon.
It is not otherwise improbable that the palace of Menelaus should
not be at Sparta; and if it was not there, that Telemachus
should say,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;for I am going to Sparta, and to Pylus,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>for this seems to agree with the epithets applied to the country,<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">156</a>
unless indeed any one should allow this to be a poetical
licence; for, if Messenia was a part of Laconia, it would be a
contradiction that Messene should not be placed together with
Laconia, or with Pylus, (which was under the command of
Nestor,) nor by itself in the Catalogue of Ships, as though it
had no part in the expedition.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">After</span> Male&aelig; follow the Argolic and Hermionic Gulfs;
the former extends as far as Scyll&aelig;um,<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a> it looks to the east,
and towards the Cyclades;<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">158</a> the latter lies still more towards
the east than the former, reaching &AElig;gina and the Epidaurian
territory.<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">159</a> The Laconians occupy the first part of the
Argolic Gulf, and the Argives the rest. Among the places
occupied by the Laconians are Delium,<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">160</a> a temple of Apollo, of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]<br />[CAS. 368]</a></span>
the same name as that in B&#339;otia; Minoa, a fortress of the
same name as that in Megara; and according to Artemidorus,
Epidaurus Limera;<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">161</a> Apollodorus, however, places it near
Cythera,<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">162</a> and having a convenient harbour, (&#955;&#953;&#956;&#8052;&#957;, limen,) it
was called Limenera, which was altered by contraction to Limera.
A great part of the coast of Laconia, beginning immediately
from Male&aelig;, is rugged. It has however shelters
for vessels, and harbours. The remainder of the coast has
good ports; there are also many small islands, not worthy of
mention, lying in front of it.</p>

<p>2. To the Argives belong Prasi&aelig;,<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">163</a> and Temenium<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">164</a> where
Temenus lies buried. Before coming to Temenium is the district
through which the river Lerna flows, that having the same
name as the lake, where is laid the scene of the fable of the
Hydra. The Temenium is distant from Argos 26 stadia from
the sea-coast; from Argos to Her&aelig;um are 40, and thence to
Mycen&aelig; 10 stadia.</p>

<p>Next to Temenium is Nauplia, the naval station of the
Argives. Its name is derived from its being accessible to
ships. Here they say the fiction of the moderns originated
respecting Nauplius and his sons, for Homer would not have
omitted to mention them, if Palamedes displayed so much
wisdom and intelligence, and was unjustly put to death; and
if Nauplius had destroyed so many people at Caphareus.<a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">165</a> But
the genealogy offends both against the mythology, and against
chronology. For if we allow that he was the son of Neptune,<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">166</a>
how could he be the son of Amymone, and be still living in
the Trojan times.</p>

<p>Next to Nauplia are caves, and labyrinths constructed in
them, which caves they call Cyclopeia.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>3. Then follow other places, and after these the Hermionic
Gulf. Since the poet places this gulf in the Argive territory,
we must not overlook this division of the circumference of
this country. It begins from the small city Asine;<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">167</a> then
follow Hermione,<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">168</a> and Tr&#339;zen.<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">169</a> In the voyage along the
coast the island Calauria<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">170</a> lies opposite; it has a compass of
30 stadia, and is separated from the continent by a strait of
4 stadia.</p>

<p>4. Then follows the Saronic Gulf; some call it a Pontus or
sea, others a Porus or passage, whence it is also termed the
Saronic pelagos or deep. The whole of the passage, or Porus,
extending from the Hermionic Sea, and the sea about the
Isthmus (of Corinth) to the Myrtoan and Cretan Seas, has this
name.</p>

<p>To the Saronic Gulf belong Epidaurus,<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">171</a> and the island in
front of it, &AElig;gina; then Cenchre&aelig;, the naval station of the
Corinthians towards the eastern parts; then Sch&#339;nus,<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">172</a> a harbour
at the distance of 45 stadia by sea; from Male&aelig; the
whole number of stadia is about 1800.</p>

<p>At Sch&#339;nus is the Diolcus, or place where they draw the
vessels across the Isthmus: it is the narrowest part of it.
Near Sch&#339;nus is the temple of the Isthmian Neptune. At
present, however, I shall not proceed with the description of
these places, for they are not situated within the Argive territory,
but resume the account of those which it contains.</p>

<p>5. And first, we may observe how frequently Argos is
mentioned by the poet, both by itself and with the epithet designating
it as Ach&aelig;an Argos, Argos Jasum, Argos Hippium,
or Hippoboton, or Pelasgicum. The city, too, is called Argos,</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>for the city could not be called his house; and he calls the
whole of Greece, Argos, for he calls all Argives, as he calls
them Danai, and Ach&aelig;ans.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]<br />[CAS. 369]</a></span></p>

<p>He distinguishes the identity of name by epithets; he calls
Thessaly, Pelasgic Argos;</p>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">

</div></div></div>

<p>intimating in these lines that the Peloponnesians were called
peculiarly Ach&aelig;ans according to another designation.</p>

<p>He calls also the Peloponnesus, Argos Jasum;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div></div></div>

<p>meaning Penelope, she then would have a greater number of
suitors; for it is not probable that he means those from the
whole of Greece, but those from the neighbourhood of Ithaca.
He applies also to Argos terms common to other places,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>6. There is a controversy about the names Hellas and Hellenes.
Thucydides<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">180</a> says that Homer nowhere mentions Barbarians,
because the Greeks were not distinguished by any
single name, which expressed its opposite. Apollodorus also
says, that the inhabitants of Thessaly alone were called Hellenes,
and alleges this verse of the poet,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;they were called Myrmidones, and Hellenes;&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">181</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>but Hesiod, and Archilochus, in their time knew that they
were all called Hellenes, and Panhellenes: the former calls
them by this name in speaking of the Pr&#339;tides, and says that
Panhellenes were their suitors; the latter, where he says</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;that the calamities of the Panhellenes centred in Thasus.&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But others oppose to this, that Homer does mention Barbarians,
when he says of the Carians, that they spoke a barbarous
language, and that all the Hellenes were comprised in
the term Hellas;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>7. The greater part of the city of the Argives is situated in
a plain. It has a citadel called Larisa, a hill moderately fortified,
and upon it a temple of Jupiter. Near it flows the Inachus,
a torrent river; its source is in Lyrceium [the Arcadian
mountain near Cynuria]. We have said before that the
fabulous stories about its sources are the inventions of poets;
it is a fiction also that Argos is without water&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

&#8220;but the gods made Argos a land without water.&#8221;</div>

<p>Now the ground consists of hollows, it is intersected by rivers,

<p>8. The Inachus<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">190</a> is one of the rivers, which flows through
the Argive territory; there is also another in Argia, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]<br />[CAS. 371]</a></span>
Eras&#299;nus. It has its source in Stymphalus in Arcadia, and in
the lake there called Stymphalis, where the scene is laid of
the fable of the birds called Stymphalides, which Hercules
drove away by wounding them with arrows, and by the noise
of drums. It is said that this river passes under-ground, and
issues forth in the Argian territory, and waters the plain.
The Eras&#299;nus is also called Ars&#299;nus.</p>

<p>Another river of the same name flows out of Arcadia to
the coast near Buras. There is another Erasinus also in
Eretria, and one in Attica near Brauron.</p>

<p>Near Lerna a fountain is shown, called Amymone. The
lake Lerna, the haunt of the Hydra, according to the fable,
belongs to the Argive and Messenian districts. The expiatory
purifications performed at this place by persons guilty
of crimes gave rise to the proverb, &#8220;A Lerna of evils.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is allowed that, although the city itself lies in a spot where
there are no running streams of water, there is an abundance
of wells, which are attributed to the Dana&iuml;des as their invention;
hence the line,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;the Dana&iuml;des made waterless Argos, Argos the watered.&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Four of the wells are esteemed sacred, and held in peculiar
veneration. Hence they occasioned a want of water, while
they supplied it abundantly.</p>

<p>9. Danaus is said to have built the citadel of the Argives.
He seems to have possessed so much more power than the
former rulers of the country, that, according to Euripides,</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;he made a law that those who were formerly called Pelasgiot&aelig;, should
be called Danai throughout Greece.&#8221;</p>

<p>His tomb, called Palinthus, is in the middle of the market-place
of the Argives. I suppose that the celebrity of this city
was the reason of all the Greeks having the name of Pelasgiot&aelig;,
and Danai, as well as Argives.</p>

<p>Modern writers speak of Iasid&aelig;, and Argos Iasum, and
Apia, and Apidones. Homer does not mention Apidones, and
uses the word apia only to express distance. That he means
Peloponnesus by Argos we may conclude from these lines,</p>

<p>Argos, among modern writers, denotes a plain, but not once
in Homer. It seems rather a Macedonian and Thessalian
use of the word.</p>

<p>10. After the descendants of Danaus had succeeded to the
sovereignty at Argos, and the Amythaonid&aelig;, who came from
Pisatis and Triphylia, were intermixed with them by marriages,
it is not surprising that, being allied to one another,
they at first divided the country into two kingdoms, in such a
manner that the two cities, the intended capitals, Argos and
Mycen&aelig;, were not distant from each other more than 50 stadia,
and that the Her&aelig;um at Mycen&aelig; should be a temple common
to both. In this temple were the statues the workmanship of
Polycletus. In display of art they surpassed all others, but
in magnitude and cost they were inferior to those of Pheidias.</p>

<p>At first Argos was the most powerful of the two cities. Afterwards
Mycen&aelig; received a great increase of inhabitants in
consequence of the migration thither of the Pelopid&aelig;. For when
everything had fallen under the power of the sons of Atreus,
Agamemnon, the elder, assumed the sovereign authority, and
by good fortune and valour annexed to his possessions a large
tract of country. He also added the Laconian to the Mycen&aelig;an
district.<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">195</a> Menelaus had Laconia, and Agamemnon Mycen&aelig;,
and the country as far as Corinth, and Sicyon, and the territory
which was then said to be the country of Iones and
&AElig;gialians, and afterwards of Ach&aelig;i.</p>

<p>After the Trojan war, when the dominion of Agamemnon was
at an end, the declension of Mycen&aelig; ensued, and particularly
after the return of the Heracleid&aelig;.<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">196</a> For when these people
got possession of Peloponnesus, they expelled its former masters,
so that they who had Argos possessed Mycen&aelig; likewise,
as composing one body. In subsequent times Mycen&aelig; was
razed by the Argives, so that at present not even a trace is to
be discovered of the city of the Mycen&aelig;ans.<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">197</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]<br />[CAS. 372]</a></span></p>

<p>If Mycen&aelig; experienced this fate, it is not surprising that
some of the cities mentioned in the Catalogue of the Ships,
and said to be subject to Argos, have disappeared. These are
the words of the Catalogue:</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;They who occupied Argos, and Tiryns, with strong walls, and Hermione,
and Asine situated on a deep bay, and E&iuml;ones, and Epidaurus with its
vines, and the valiant Ach&aelig;an youths who occupied &AElig;gina, and Mases.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">198</a></p>

<p>Among these we have already spoken of Argos; we must now
speak of the rest.</p>

<p>11. Pr&#339;tus seems to have used Tiryns as a stronghold,
and to have fortified it by means of the Cyclopes. There
were seven of them, and were called Gasterocheires,<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">199</a> because
they subsisted by their art. They were sent for and came
from Lycia. Perhaps the caverns about Nauplia, and the
works there, have their name from these people. The citadel
Licymna has its name from Licymnius. It is distant from
Nauplia about 12 stadia. This place is deserted, as well as the
neighbouring Mid&eacute;a, which is different from the B&#339;otian
M&iacute;dea, for that is accentuated M&iacute;dea, like &#960;&#961;&#8057;&#957;&#959;&#953;&#945;, but this is
accentuated Mid&eacute;a, like Teg&eacute;a.</p>

<p>Prosymna borders upon Mid&eacute;a; it has also a temple of
Juno. The Argives have depopulated most of these for their
refusal to submit to their authority. Of the inhabitants some
went from Tiryns to Epidaurus; others from Hermione to the
Halieis (the Fishermen), as they are called; others were transferred
by the Laced&aelig;monians to Messenia from Asine, (which
is itself a village in the Argive territory near Nauplia,) and
they built a small city of the same name as the Argolic Asine.
For the Laced&aelig;monians, according to Theopompus, got possession
of a large tract of country belonging to other nations,
and settled there whatever fugitives they had received, who
had taken refuge among them; and it was to this country the
Nauplians had retreated.</p>

<p>12. Hermione is one of the cities, not undistinguished.
The coast is occupied by Halieis, as they are called, a tribe
who subsist by being employed on the sea in fishing. There
is a general opinion among the Hermionenses that there is a
short descent from their country to Hades, and hence they do
not place in the mouths of the dead the fare for crossing the
Styx.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>13. It is said that Asine as well as Hermione was inhabited
by Dryopes; either Dryops the Arcadian having transferred
them thither from the places near the Spercheius, according
to Aristotle; or, Hercules expelled them from Doris near
Parnassus.</p>

<p>Scyll&aelig;um near Hermione has its name, it is said, from
Scylla, daughter of Nisus. According to report, she was
enamoured of Minos, and betrayed to him Nis&aelig;a. She was
drowned by order of her father, and her body was thrown
upon the shore, and buried here.</p>

<p>E&iuml;ones was a kind of village which the Mycen&aelig;i depopulated,
and converted into a station for vessels. It was afterwards
destroyed, and is no longer a naval station.</p>

<p>14. Tr&#339;zen is sacred to Neptune,<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">200</a> from whom it was
formerly called Poseidonia. It is situated 15 stadia from the
sea. Nor is this an obscure city. In front of its harbour,
called Pogon,<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">201</a> lies Calauria, a small island, of about 30 stadia
in compass. Here was a temple of Neptune, which served as
an asylum for fugitives. It is said that this god exchanged
Delos for Calauria with Latona, and T&aelig;narum for Pytho with
Apollo. Ephorus mentions the oracle respecting it:</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">&#8220;It is the same thing to possess Delos, or Calauria,</div>
<div class="line">The divine Pytho, or the windy T&aelig;narum.&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>There was a sort of Amphictyonic body to whom the concerns
of this temple belonged, consisting of seven cities, which
performed sacrifices in common. These were Hermon, Epidaurus,
&AElig;gina, Athen&aelig;, Prasi&aelig;, Nauplia, and Orchomenus
Minyeius. The Argives contributed in behalf of Nauplia, and
the Laced&aelig;monians in behalf of Prasi&aelig;. The veneration
for this god prevailed so strongly among the Greeks, that
the Macedonians, even when masters of the country, nevertheless
preserved even to the present time the privilege of
the asylum, and were restrained by shame from dragging
away the suppliants who took refuge at Calauria. Archias
even, with a body of soldiers, did not dare to use force to Demosthenes,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]<br />[CAS. 372]</a></span>
although he had received orders from Antipater
to bring him alive, and all other orators he could find, who
were accused of the same crimes. He attempted persuasion,
but in vain, for Demosthenes deprived himself of life by taking
poison in the temple.<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">202</a></p>

<p>Tr&#339;zen and Pittheus, the sons of Pelops, having set out
from Pisatis to Argos, the former left behind him a city of his
own name; Pittheus succeeded him, and became king. Anthes,
who occupied the territory before, set sail, and founded
Halicarnassus. We shall speak of him in our account of
Caria and the Troad.</p>

<p>15. Epidaurus was called Epitaurus [Epicarus?]. Aristotle
says, that Carians occupied both this place and Hermione,
but upon the return of the Heracleid&aelig; those Ionians, who had
accompanied them from the Athenian Tetrapolis to Argos,
settled there together with the Carians.</p>

<p>Epidaurus<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">203</a> was a distinguished city, remarkable particularly
on account of the fame of &AElig;sculapius, who was supposed
to cure every kind of disease, and whose temple is
crowded constantly with sick persons, and its walls covered
with votive tablets, which are hung upon the walls, and contain
accounts of the cures, in the same manner as is practised
at Cos, and at Tricca. The city lies in the recess of the
Saronic Gulf, with a coasting navigation of 15 stadia, and its
aspect is towards the point of summer sunrise. It is surrounded
with lofty mountains, which extend to the coast, so
that it is strongly fortified by nature on all sides.</p>

<p>Between Tr&#339;zen and Epidaurus, there was a fortress Methana,<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">204</a>
and a peninsula of the same name. In some copies of
Thucydides Methone is the common reading,<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">205</a> a place of the
same name with the Macedonian city, at the siege of which
Philip lost an eye. Hence Demetrius of Scepsis is of opinion,
that some persons were led into error by the name, and supposed
that it was Methone near Tr&#339;zen. It was against this
town, it is said, that the persons sent by Agamemnon to levy
sailors, uttered the imprecation, that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;they might never cease to build walls,&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>but it was not these people; but the Macedonians, according
to Theopompus, who refused the levy of men; besides it is
not probable that those, who were in the neighbourhood of
Agamemnon, would disobey his orders.</p>

<p>16. &AElig;gina is a place in the territory of Epidaurus. There
is in front of this continent, an island, of which the poet means
to speak in the lines before cited. Wherefore some write,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;and the island &AElig;gina,&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>instead of</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;and they who occupied &AElig;gina,&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>making a distinction between the places of the same name.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to remark, that this island is among the
most celebrated. It was the country of &AElig;acus and his descendants.
It was this island which once possessed so much
power at sea, and formerly disputed the superiority with the
Athenians in the sea-fight at Salamis during the Persian war.<a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">206</a>
The circuit of the island is said to be about 180 stadia. It
has a city of the same name on the south-west. Around it
are Attica, and Megara, and the parts of Peloponnesus as far
as Epidaurus. It is distant from each about 100 stadia. The
eastern and southern sides are washed by the Myrtoan and
Cretan seas. Many small islands surround it on the side
towards the continent, but Belbina is situated on the side
towards the open sea. The land has soil at a certain depth,
but it is stony at the surface, particularly the plain country,
whence the whole has a bare appearance, but yields large crops
of barley. It is said that the &AElig;ginet&aelig; were called Myrmidones,
not as the fable accounts for the name, when the ants
were metamorphosed into men, at the time of a great famine,
by the prayer of &AElig;acus; but because by digging, like ants,
they threw up the earth upon the rocks, and were thus made
able to cultivate the ground, and because they lived in excavations
under-ground, abstaining from the use of bricks
and sparing of the soil for this purpose.</p>

<p>Its ancient name was &#338;none, which is the name of two of
the demi in Attica, one near Eleuther&aelig;;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;to inhabit the plains close to &#338;none, (&#338;noe,) and Eleuther&aelig;;&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>and another, one of the cities of the Tetrapolis near Marathon,
to which the proverb is applied,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="line">
&#8220;&#338;none (&#338;noe?) and its torrent.&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]<br />[CAS. 375]</a></span></p>

<p>Its inhabitants were in succession Argives, Cretans, Epidaurians,
and Dorians. At last the Athenians divided the island by
lot among settlers of their own. The Laced&aelig;monians, however,
deprived the Athenians of it, and restored it to the ancient inhabitants.</p>

<p>The &AElig;ginet&aelig; sent out colonists to Cydonia<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">207</a> in Crete, and
to the Ombrici. According to Ephorus, silver was first struck
as money by Pheidon. The island became a mart, the inhabitants,
on account of the fertility of its soil, employing themselves
at sea as traders; whence goods of a small kind had
the name of &#8220;&AElig;gina wares.&#8221;</p>

<p>17. The poet frequently speaks of places in succession as
they are situated;</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>for Crocyleia is in Acarnania. Thus he here joins with &AElig;gina
Mases, which belongs to the continent of Argolis.</p>

<p>Homer does not mention Thyre&aelig;, but other writers speak
of it as well known. It was the occasion of a contest between
the three hundred Argives against the same number of Laced&aelig;monians;
the latter were conquerors by means of a stratagem
of Othryadas. Thucydides places Thyre&aelig; in Cynuria,
on the confines of Argia and Laconia.<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">212</a></p>

<p>Hysi&aelig; also is a celebrated place in Argolica; and Cenchre&aelig;,
which lies on the road from Tegea to Argos, over the mountain
Parthenius, and the Creopolus.<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">213</a> But Homer was not
acquainted with either of these places, [nor with the Lyrceium,
nor Orne&aelig;, and yet they are villages in the Argian
territory; the former of the same name as the mountain there;
the latter of the same name as the Orne&aelig;, situated between
Corinth and Sicyon].<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">214</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>18. Among the cities of the Peloponnesus, the most celebrated
were, and are at this time, Argos and Sparta, and as their renown
is spread everywhere, it is not necessary to describe
them at length, for if we did so, we should seem to repeat
what is said by all writers.</p>

<p>Anciently, Argos was the most celebrated, but afterwards
the Laced&aelig;monians obtained the superiority, and continued to
maintain their independence, except during some short interval,
when they experienced a reverse of fortune.</p>

<p>The Argives did not admit Pyrrhus within the city. He
fell before the walls, an old woman having let a tile drop from
a house upon his head.</p>

<p>They were, however, under the sway of other kings. When
they belonged to the Ach&aelig;an league they were subjected, together
with the other members of that confederacy, to the
power of the Romans. The city subsists at present, and is
second in rank to Sparta.</p>

<p>19. We shall next speak of those places which are said, in
the Catalogue of the Ships, to be under the government of
Mycen&aelig; and Agamemnon: the lines are these:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line c">&#8220;Those who inhabited Mycen&aelig;, a well-built city,</div>
<div class="line c">and the wealthy Corinth, and Cleon&aelig; well built,</div>
<div class="line c">and Ornei&aelig;, and the lovely Ar&aelig;thyrea,</div>
<div class="line c">and Sicyon, where Adrastus first reigned,</div>
<div class="line c">and they who inhabited Hyperesia, and the lofty Gonoessa,</div>
<div class="line c">and Pellene, and &AElig;gium,</div>
<div class="line c">and the whole range of the coast, and those who lived near the spacious Helice.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">215</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Mycen&aelig; exists no longer. It was founded by Perseus.
Sthenelus succeeded Perseus; and Eurystheus, Sthenelus.
These same persons were kings of Argos also. It is said that
Eurystheus, having engaged, with the assistance of the Athenians,
in an expedition to Marathon against the descendants
of Hercules and Iolaus, fell in battle, and that the remainder
of his body was buried at Gargettus, but his head apart from
it at Tricorythus<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">216</a> (Corinth?), Iolaus having severed it from
the body near the fountain Macaria, close to the chariot-road.
The spot itself has the name of &#8220;Eurystheus&#8217;-head.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mycen&aelig; then passed into the possession of the Pelopid&aelig;,
who had left the Pisatis, then into that of the Heracleid&aelig;,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]<br />[CAS. 377]</a></span>
who were also masters of Argos. But after the sea-fight at
Salamis, the Argives, together with the Cleon&aelig;i, and the Teget&aelig;,
invaded Mycen&aelig;, and razed it, and divided the territory
among themselves. The tragic writers, on account of the
proximity of the two cities, speak of them as one, and use the
name of one for the other. Euripides in the same play calls
the same city in one place Mycen&aelig;, and in another Argos, as
in the Iphigeneia,<a name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">217</a> and in the Orestes.<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">218</a></p>

<p>Cleon&aelig; is a town situated upon the road leading from Argos
to Corinth, on an eminence, which is surrounded on all
sides by dwellings, and well fortified, whence, in my opinion,
Cleon&aelig; was properly described as &#8220;well built.&#8221; There also,
between Cleon&aelig; and Phlius, is Nemea, and the grove where
it was the custom of the Argives to celebrate the Nemean
games: here is the scene of the fable of the Nemean Lion,
and here also the village Bembina. Cleon&aelig; is distant from
Argos 120 stadia, and 80 from Corinth. And we have ourselves
beheld the city from the Acrocorinthus.</p>

<p>20. Corinth is said to be opulent from its mart. It is
situated upon the isthmus. It commands two harbours, one
near Asia, the other near Italy, and facilitates, by reason of so
short a distance between them, an exchange of commodities
on each side.</p>

<p>As the Sicilian strait, so formerly these seas were of difficult
navigation, and particularly the sea above Male&aelig;, on account
of the prevalence of contrary winds; whence the common
proverb,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;When you double Male&aelig; forget your home.&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>It was a desirable thing for the merchants coming from Asia,
and from Italy, to discharge their lading at Corinth without
being obliged to double Cape Male&aelig;. For goods exported
from Peloponnesus, or imported by land, a toll was paid to
those who had the keys of the country. This continued afterwards
for ever. In after-times they enjoyed even additional
advantages, for the Isthmian games, which were celebrated
there, brought thither great multitudes of people. The Bacchiad&aelig;,
a rich and numerous family, and of illustrious descent,
were their rulers, governed the state for nearly two hundred
years, and peaceably enjoyed the profits of the mart. Their
power was destroyed by Cypselus, who became king himself,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
and his descendants continued to exist for three generations.
A proof of the wealth of this family is the offering which
Cypselus dedicated at Olympia, a statue of Jupiter of beaten
gold.</p>

<p>Demaratus, one of those who had been tyrant at Corinth,
flying from the seditions which prevailed there, carried with
him from his home to Tyrrhenia so much wealth, that he became
sovereign of the city which had received him, and his
son became even king of the Romans.</p>

<p>The temple of Venus at Corinth was so rich, that it had
more than a thousand women consecrated to the service of the
goddess, courtesans, whom both men and women had dedicated
as offerings to the goddess. The city was frequented
and enriched by the multitudes who resorted thither on account
of these women. Masters of ships freely squandered
all their money, and hence the proverb,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;It is not in every man&#8217;s power to go to Corinth.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">219</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The answer is related of a courtesan to a woman who was
reproaching her with disliking work, and not employing herself
in spinning;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;Although I am what you see, yet, in this short time, I have already
finished three distaffs.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">220</a></p>

<p>21. The position of the city as it is described by Hieronymus,
and Eudoxus, and others, and from our own observation,
since its restoration by the Romans, is as follows.</p>

<p>That which is called the Acrocorinthus is a lofty mountain,
perpendicular, and about three stadia and a half in height.
There is an ascent of 30 stadia, and it terminates in a sharp
point. The steepest part is towards the north. Below it lies
the city in a plain of the form of a trapezium, at the very foot
of the Acrocorinthus. The compass of the city itself was 40
stadia, and all that part which was not protected by the
mountain was fortified by a wall. Even the mountain itself,
the Acrocorinthus, was comprehended within this wall,
wherever it would admit of fortification. As I ascended it,
the ruins of the circuit of the foundation were apparent, which
gave a circumference of about 85 stadia. The other sides of
the mountain are less steep; hence, however, it stretches onwards,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]<br />[CAS. 379]</a></span>
and is visible everywhere. The summit has upon it a
small temple of Venus, and below it is the fountain Peirene,
which has no efflux, but is continually full of water, which is
transparent, and fit for drinking. They say, that from the
compression of this, and of some other small under-ground
veins, originates that spring at the foot of the mountain, which
runs into the city, and furnishes the inhabitants with a sufficient
supply of water. There is a large number of wells in
the city, and it is said in the Acrocorinthus also, but this I
did not see. When Euripides says,</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;I come from the Acrocorinthus, well-watered on all sides, the sacred
hill and habitation of Venus,&#8221;</p>

<p>the epithet &#8220;well-watered on all sides,&#8221; must be understood to
refer to depth; pure springs and under-ground rills are dispersed
through the mountain; or we must suppose, that, anciently,
the Peirene overflowed, and irrigated the mountain.
There, it is said, Pegasus was taken by Bellerophon, while
drinking; this was a winged horse, which sprung from the
neck of Medusa when the head of the Gorgon was severed
from the body. This was the horse, it is said, which caused
the Hippocrene, or Horse&#8217;s Fountain, to spring up in Helicon
by striking the rock with its hoof.</p>

<p>Below Peirene is the Sisypheium, which preserves a large
portion of the ruins of a temple, or palace, built of white marble.
From the summit towards the north are seen Parnassus
and Helicon, lofty mountains covered with snow; then the
Criss&aelig;an Gulf,<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">221</a> lying below both, and surrounded by Phocis,
B&#339;otia, Megaris, by the Corinthian district opposite to Phocis,
and by Sicyonia on the west. * * * *</p>

<p>Above all these are situated the Oneia<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">222</a> mountains, as they
are called, extending as far as B&#339;otia and Cith&aelig;ron, from
the Sceironides rocks, where the road leads along them to
Attica.</p>

<p>22. Lech&aelig;um is the commencement of the coast on one
side; and on the other, Cenchre&aelig;, a village with a harbour,
distant from the city about 70 stadia. The latter serves for
the trade with Asia, and Lech&aelig;um for that with Italy.</p>

<p>Lech&aelig;um is situated below the city, and is not well inhabited.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>There are long walls of about 12 stadia in length,
stretching on each side of the road towards Lech&aelig;um. The
sea-shore, extending hence to Pag&aelig; in Megaris, is washed by
the Corinthian Gulf. It is curved, and forms the Diolcus, or
the passage along which vessels are drawn over the Isthmus
to the opposite coast at Sch&#339;nus near Cenchre&aelig;.</p>

<p>Between Lech&aelig;um and Pag&aelig;, anciently, there was the
oracle of the Acr&aelig;an Juno, and Olmi&aelig;, the promontory that
forms the gulf, on which are situated &#338;noe, and Pag&aelig;; the
former is a fortress of the Megarians; and &#338;noe is a fortress
of the Corinthians.</p>

<p>Next to Cenchre&aelig;<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">223</a> is Sch&#339;nus, where is the narrow part
of the Diolcus, then Crommyonia. In front of this coast lies
the Saronic Gulf, and the Eleusiniac, which is almost the same,
and continuous with the Hermionic. Upon the Isthmus is the
temple of the Isthmian Neptune, shaded above with a grove of
pine trees, where the Corinthians celebrated the Isthmian games.</p>

<p>Crommyon<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">224</a> is a village of the Corinthian district, and formerly
belonging to that of Megaris, where is laid the scene of
the fable of the Crommyonian sow, which, it is said, was the
dam of the Calydonian boar, and, according to tradition, the
destruction of this sow was one of the labours of Theseus.</p>

<p>Tenea is a village of the Corinthian territory, where there
was a temple of Apollo Teneates. It is said that Archias,
who equipped a colony for Syracuse, was accompanied by a
great number of settlers from this place; and that this settlement
afterwards flourished more than any others, and at length
had an independent form of government of its own. When
they revolted from the Corinthians, they attached themselves
to the Romans, and continued to subsist when Corinth was
destroyed.</p>

<p>An answer of an oracle is circulated, which was returned
to an Asiatic, who inquired whether it was better to migrate
to Corinth;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;Corinth is prosperous, but I would belong to Tenea;&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]<br />[CAS. 380]</a></span></p>

<p>which last word was perverted by some through ignorance,
and altered to Tegea. Here, it is said, Polybus brought up
&#338;dipus.</p>

<p>There seems to be some affinity between the Tenedii and
these people, through Tennus, the son of Cycnus, according
to Aristotle; the similarity, too, of the divine honours paid
by both to Apollo affords no slight proof of this relationship.<a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">225</a></p>

<p>23. The Corinthians, when subject to Philip, espoused his
party very zealously, and individually conducted themselves
so contemptuously towards the Romans, that persons ventured
to throw down filth upon their ambassadors, when passing by
their houses. They were immediately punished for these and
other offences and insults. A large army was sent out under
the command of Lucius Mummius, who razed the city.<a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">226</a> The
rest of the country, as far as Macedonia, was subjected to the
Romans under different generals. The Sicyonii, however,
had the largest part of the Corinthian territory.</p>

<p>Polybius relates with regret what occurred at the capture
of the city, and speaks of the indifference the soldiers showed
for works of art, and the sacred offerings of the temples. He
says, that he was present, and saw pictures thrown upon the
ground, and soldiers playing at dice upon them. Among
others, he specifies by name the picture of Bacchus<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">227</a> by Aristeides,
(to which it is said the proverb was applied, &#8220;Nothing
to the Bacchus,&#8221;) and Hercules tortured in the robe, the gift
of De&iuml;aneira.<a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">228</a> This I have not myself seen, but I have seen the
picture of the Bacchus suspended in the Demetreium at Rome,
a very beautiful piece of art, which, together with the temple,
was lately consumed by fire. The greatest number and the
finest of the other offerings in Rome were brought from Corinth.
Some of them were in the possession of the cities in
the neighbourhood of Rome. For Mummius being more
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
brave and generous than an admirer of the arts, presented
them without hesitation to those who asked for them.<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">229</a> Lucullus,
having built the temple of Good Fortune, and a portico,
requested of Mummius the use of some statues, under the
pretext of ornamenting the temple with them at the time of
its dedication, and promised to restore them. He did not,
however, restore, but presented them as sacred offerings, and
told Mummius to take them away if he pleased. Mummius
did not resent this conduct, not caring about the statues, but
obtained more honour than Lucullus, who presented them as
sacred offerings.</p>

<p>Corinth remained a long time deserted, till at length it was
restored on account of its natural advantages by divus C&aelig;sar,
who sent colonists thither, who consisted, for the most part, of
the descendants of free-men.</p>

<p>On moving the ruins, and digging open the sepulchres,
an abundance of works in pottery with figures on them, and
many in brass, were found. The workmanship was admired,
and all the sepulchres were examined with the greatest care.
Thus was obtained a large quantity of things, which were
disposed of at a great price, and Rome filled with Necro-Corinthia,
by which name were distinguished the articles taken
out of the sepulchres, and particularly the pottery. At first
these latter were held in as much esteem as the works of the
Corinthian artists in brass, but this desire to have them did
not continue, not only because the supply failed, but because
the greatest part of them were not well executed.<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">230</a></p>

<p>The city of Corinth was large and opulent at all periods,
and produced a great number of statesmen and artists. For
here in particular, and at Sicyon, flourished painting, and
modelling, and every art of this kind.</p>

<p>The soil was not very fertile; its surface was uneven and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]<br />[CAS. 382]</a></span>
rugged, whence all writers describe Corinth as full of brows
of hills, and apply the proverb,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">&#8220;Corinth rises with brows of hills, and sinks into hollows.&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>24. Orne&aelig; has the same name as the river which flows beside
it. At present it is deserted; formerly, it was well inhabited,
and contained a temple of Priapus, held in veneration.
It is from this place that Euphronius, (Euphorius?) the author
of a poem, the Priapeia, applies the epithet Orneates to the
god.</p>

<p>It was situated above the plain of the Sicyonians, but the
Argives were masters of the country.</p>

<p>Ar&aelig;thyrea<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">231</a> is now called Phliasia. It had a city of the
same name as the country near the mountain Celossa. They
afterwards removed thence and built a city at the distance of
30 stadia, which they called Phlius.<a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">232</a> Part of the mountain
Celossa is the Carneates, whence the Asopus takes its rise,
which flows by Sicyon,<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">233</a> and forms the Asopian district,
which is a part of Sicyonia. There is also an Asopus, which
flows by Thebes, and Plat&aelig;a, and Tanagra. There is another
also in Heracleia Trachinia, which flows beside a village,
called Parasopii, and a fourth at Paros.</p>

<p>Phlius is situated in the middle of a circle formed by Sicyonia,
Argeia, Cleon&aelig;, and Stymphalus. At Phlius and at
Sicyon the temple of Dia, a name given to Hebe, is held in
veneration.</p>

<p>25. Sicyon was formerly called Mecone, and at a still earlier
period, &AElig;giali. It was rebuilt high up in the country about
20, others say, about 12, stadia from the sea, upon an eminence
naturally strong, which is sacred to Ceres. The buildings
anciently consisted of a naval arsenal and a harbour.</p>

<p>Sicyonia is separated by the river Nemea from the Corinthian
territory. It was formerly governed for a very long period
by tyrants, but they were always persons of mild and
moderate disposition. Of these, the most illustrious was
Aratus, who made the city free, and was the chief of the
Ach&aelig;ans, who voluntarily conferred upon him that power;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
he extended the confederacy by annexing to it his own country,
and the other neighbouring cities.</p>

<p>Hyperesia, and the cities next in order in the Catalogue of
the poet, and &AElig;gialus,<a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">234</a> [or the sea-coast,] as far as Dyme, and
the borders of the Eleian territory, belong to the Ach&aelig;ans.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER VII.</h3>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">The</span> Ionians, who were descendants of the Athenians,
were, anciently, masters of this country. It was formerly
called &AElig;gialeia, and the inhabitants &AElig;gialeans, but in later
times, Ionia, from the former people, as Attica had the name
of Ionia, from Ion the son of Xuthus.</p>

<p>It is said, that Hellen was the son of Deucalion, and that
he governed the country about Phthia between the Peneius
and Asopus, and transmitted to his eldest son these dominions,
sending the others out of their native country to seek a settlement
each of them for himself. Dorus, one of them, settled
the Dorians about Parnassus, and when he left them, they bore
his name. Xuthus, another, married the daughter of Erechtheus,
and was the founder of the Tetrapolis of Attica, which
consisted of &#338;noe, Marathon, Probalinthus, and Tricorythus.</p>

<p>Ach&aelig;us, one of the sons of Xuthus, having committed an
accidental murder, fled to Laced&aelig;mon, and occasioned the inhabitants
to take the name of Ach&aelig;ans.<a name="FNanchor_235" id="FNanchor_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">235</a></p>

<p>Ion, the other son, having vanquished the Thracian army
with their leader Eumolpus, obtained so much renown, that
the Athenians intrusted him with the government of their
state. It was he who first distributed the mass of the people
into four tribes, and these again into four classes according to
their occupations, husbandmen, artificers, priests, and the
fourth, military guards; after having made many more regulations
of this kind, he left to the country his own name.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]<br />[CAS. 383]</a></span></p>

<p>It happened at that time that the country had such an
abundance of inhabitants, that the Athenians sent out a colony
of Ionians to Peloponnesus, and the tract of country
which they occupied was called Ionia after their own name,
instead of &AElig;gialeia, and the inhabitants Ionians instead of
&AElig;gialeans, who were distributed among twelve cities.</p>

<p>After the return of the Heracleid&aelig;, these Ionians, being
expelled by the Ach&aelig;ans, returned to Athens, whence, in conjunction
with the Codrid&aelig;, (descendants of Codrus,) they sent
out the Ionian colonists to Asia.<a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">236</a> They founded twelve cities
on the sea-coast of Caria and Lydia, having distributed themselves
over the country into as many parts as they occupied in
Peloponnesus.<a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">237</a></p>

<p>The Ach&aelig;ans were Phthiot&aelig; by descent, and were settled at
Laced&aelig;mon, but when the Heracleid&aelig; became masters of the
country, having recovered their power under Tisamenus, the
son of Orestes, they attacked the Ionians, as I said before,
and defeated them. They drove the Ionians out of the country,
and took possession of the territory, but retained the
same partition of it which they found existing there. They
became so powerful, that, although the Heracleid&aelig;, from whom
they had revolted, occupied the rest of Peloponnesus, yet they
defended themselves against them all, and called their own
country Ach&aelig;a.</p>

<p>From Tisamenus to Ogyges they continued to be governed
by kings. Afterwards they established a democracy, and acquired
so great renown for their political wisdom, that the
Italian Greeks, after their dissensions with the Pythagoreans,
adopted most of the laws and institutions of the Ach&aelig;ans. After
the battle of Leuctra the Thebans<a name="FNanchor_238" id="FNanchor_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">238</a> committed the disputes of
the cities among each other to the arbitration of the Ach&aelig;ans.
At a later period their community was dissolved by the Macedonians,
but they recovered by degrees their former power.
At the time of the expedition of Pyrrhus into Italy they began
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
with the union of four cities, among which were Patr&aelig;
and Dyme.<a name="FNanchor_239" id="FNanchor_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">239</a> They then had an accession of the twelve cities,
with the exception of Olenus and Helice; the former refused
to join the league; the other was swallowed up by the waves.</p>

<p>2. For the sea was raised to a great height by an earthquake,
and overwhelmed both Helice and the temple of the
Heliconian Neptune, whom the Ionians still hold in great
veneration, and offer sacrifices to his honour. They celebrate
at that spot the Panionian festival.<a name="FNanchor_240" id="FNanchor_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">240</a> According to the conjecture
of some persons, Homer refers to these sacrifices in
these lines,</p>

<p>It is conjectured that the age<a name="FNanchor_242" id="FNanchor_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">242</a> of the poet is later than the
migration of the Ionian colony, because he mentions the Panionian
sacrifices, which the Ionians perform in honour of the
Heliconian Neptune in the territory of Priene; for the Prienians
themselves are said to have come from Helice; a young
man also of Priene is appointed to preside as king at these
sacrifices, and to superintend the celebration of the sacred
rites. A still stronger proof is adduced from what is said by
the poet respecting the bull, for the Ionians suppose, that sacrifice
is performed with favourable omens, when the bull bellows
at the instant that he is wounded at the altar.</p>

<p>Others deny this, and transfer to Helice the proofs alleged
of the bull and the sacrifice, asserting that these things were
done there by established custom, and that the poet drew his
comparison from the festival celebrated there. Helice<a name="FNanchor_243" id="FNanchor_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">243</a> was
overwhelmed by the waves two years before the battle of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]<br />[CAS. 384]</a></span>
Leuctra. Eratosthenes says, that he himself saw the place,
and the ferrymen told him that there formerly stood in the
strait a brazen statue of Neptune, holding in his hand a hippocampus,<a name="FNanchor_244" id="FNanchor_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">244</a>
an animal which is dangerous to fishermen.</p>

<p>According to Heracleides, the inundation took place in his
time, and during the night. The city was at the distance
of 12 stadia from the sea, which overwhelmed the whole intermediate
country as well as the city. Two thousand men were
sent by the Ach&aelig;ans to collect the dead bodies, but in vain.
The territory was divided among the bordering people. This
calamity happened in consequence of the anger of Neptune,
for the Ionians, who were driven from Helice, sent particularly
to request the people of Helice to give them the image of
Neptune, or if they were unwilling to give that, to furnish
them with the model of the temple. On their refusal, the
Ionians sent to the Ach&aelig;an body, who decreed, that they should
comply with the request, but they would not obey even this
injunction. The disaster occurred in the following winter,
and after this the Ach&aelig;ans gave the Ionians the model of the
temple.</p>

<p>Hesiod mentions another Helice in Thessaly.</p>

<p>3. The Ach&aelig;ans, during a period of five and twenty years,
elected, annually, a common secretary, and two military chiefs.
Their common assembly of the council met at one place, called
Arnarium, (Homarium, or Amarium,) where these persons,
and, before their time, the Ionians, consulted on public affairs.
They afterwards resolved to elect one military chief. When
Aratus held this post, he took the Acrocorinthus from Antigonus,
and annexed the city as well as his own country to
the Ach&aelig;an league.<a name="FNanchor_245" id="FNanchor_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">245</a> He admitted the Megareans also into
the body, and, having destroyed the tyrannical governments in
each state, he made them members, after they were restored
to liberty, of the Ach&aelig;an league. * * * * * He freed, in a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
short time, Peloponnesus from the existing tyrannies; thus
Argos, Hermion, Phlius, and Megalopolis, the largest of the
Arcadian cities, were added to the Ach&aelig;an body, when they
attained their greatest increase of numbers. It was at this
time that the Romans, having expelled the Carthaginians
from Sicily, undertook an expedition against the Galat&aelig;,
who were settled about the Po.<a name="FNanchor_246" id="FNanchor_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">246</a> The Ach&aelig;ans remained
firmly united until Philop&#339;men had the military command,
but their union was gradually dissolved, after the Romans
had obtained possession of the whole of Greece. The Romans
did not treat each state in the same manner, but permitted
some to retain their own form of government, and dissolved that of others.</p>


<p><span class="gesperrt4">&nbsp;******</span></p>


<p>[He then assigns reasons for expatiating on the subject of the
Ach&aelig;ans, namely, their attainment of such a degree of power
as to be superior to the Laced&aelig;monians, and because they
were not as well known as they deserved to be from their importance.]<a name="FNanchor_247" id="FNanchor_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">247</a></p>

<p>4. The order of the places which the Ach&aelig;ans inhabited, according
to the distribution into twelve parts, is as follows.
Next to Sicyon is Pellene; &AElig;geira, the second; the third,
&AElig;g&aelig;, with a temple of Neptune; Bura, the fourth; then
Helice, where the Ionians took refuge after their defeat by the
Ach&aelig;ans, and from which place they were at last banished;
after Helice are &AElig;gium, Rhypes, Patr&aelig;, and Phara; then Olenus,
beside which runs the large river [Peirus?]; then Dyme,
and Trit&aelig;eis. The Ionians dwelt in villages, but the Ach&aelig;ans
founded cities, to some of which they afterwards united others
transferred from other quarters, as &AElig;g&aelig; to &AElig;geira, (the inhabitants,
however, were called &AElig;g&aelig;i,) and Olenus to Dyme.</p>

<p>Traces of the ancient settlement of the Olenii are to be
seen between Patr&aelig; and Dyme: there also is the famous temple
of &AElig;sculapius, distant from Dyme 40, and from Patr&aelig; 80
stadia.</p>

<p>In Eub&#339;a there is a place of the same name with the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]<br />[CAS. 386]</a></span>
&AElig;g&aelig; here, and there is a town of the name of Olenus in
&AElig;tolia, of which there remain only vestiges.</p>

<p>The poet does not mention the Olenus in Achaia, nor many
other people living near &AElig;gialus, but speaks in general terms;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;along the whole of &AElig;gialus, and about the spacious Helice.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_248" id="FNanchor_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">248</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But he mentions the &AElig;tolian Olenus in these words;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;those who occupied Pleuron and Olenus.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_249" id="FNanchor_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">249</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>He mentions both the places of the name of &AElig;g&aelig;; the
Ach&aelig;an &AElig;g&aelig; in these terms,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;who bring presents to Helice, and to &AElig;g&aelig;.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">250</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But when he says,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">&#8220;&AElig;g&aelig;, where his palace is in the depths of the sea,</div>
<div class="line">There Neptune stopped his coursers,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_251" id="FNanchor_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">251</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>it is better to understand &AElig;g&aelig; in Eub&#339;a; whence it is
probable the &AElig;g&aelig;an Sea had its name. On this sea, according
to story, Neptune made his preparations for the Trojan
war.</p>

<p>Close to the Ach&aelig;an &AElig;g&aelig; flows the river Crathis,<a name="FNanchor_252" id="FNanchor_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">252</a> augmented
by the waters of two rivers, and deriving its name
from the mixture of their streams. To this circumstance the
river Crathis in Italy owes its name.</p>

<p>5. Each of these twelve portions contained seven or eight
demi, so great was the population of the country.</p>

<p>Pellene,<a name="FNanchor_253" id="FNanchor_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">253</a> situated at the distance of 60 stadia from the sea,
is a strong fortress. There is also a village of the name of
Pellene, whence they bring the Pellenian mantles, which are
offered as prizes at the public games. It lies between &AElig;gium<a name="FNanchor_254" id="FNanchor_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">254</a>
and Pellene. But Pellana, a different place from these, belongs
to the Laced&aelig;monians, and is situated towards the territory
of Megalopolitis.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>&AElig;geira<a name="FNanchor_255" id="FNanchor_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">255</a> is situated upon a hill. Bura is at the distance
from the sea-coast of about 40 stadia. It was swallowed up
by an earthquake. It is said, that from the fountain Sybaris
which is there, the river Sybaris in Italy had its name.</p>

<p>&AElig;ga (for this is the name by which &AElig;g&aelig; is called) is not
now inhabited, but the &AElig;gienses occupy the territory. &AElig;gium,
however, is well inhabited. It was here, it is said, that Jupiter
was suckled by a goat, as Aratus also says,</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;the sacred goat, which is said to have applied its teats to the lips of
Jupiter.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_256" id="FNanchor_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">256</a></p>

<p>He adds, that,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;the priests call it the Olenian goat of Jupiter,&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>and indicates the place because it was near Olenus. There
also is Ceryneia, situated upon a lofty rock. This place, and
Helice, belong to the &AElig;gienses,<a name="FNanchor_257" id="FNanchor_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">257</a> and the &AElig;narium, [Homarium,]
the grove of Jupiter, where the Ach&aelig;ans held their convention,
when they were to deliberate upon their common affairs.</p>

<p>The river Selinus flows through the city of the &AElig;gienses.
It has the same name as that which was beside Artemisium
at Ephesus, and that in Elis, which has its course along the
spot, that Xenophon<a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">258</a> says he purchased in compliance with
the injunction of an oracle, in honour of Artemis. There is
also another Selinus in the country of the Hybl&aelig;i Megarenses,
whom the Carthaginians expelled.</p>

<p>Of the remaining Ach&aelig;an cities, or portions, Rhypes is not
inhabited, but the territory called Rhypis was occupied by
&AElig;gienses and Pharians. &AElig;schylus also says somewhere,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;the sacred Bura, and Rhypes struck with lightning.&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Myscellus, the founder of Croton, was a native of Rhypes.
Leuctrum, belonging to the district Rhypis, was a demus
of Rhypes. Between these was Patr&aelig;, a considerable city,
and in the intervening country, at the distance of 40 stadia
from Patr&aelig;, are Rhium,<a name="FNanchor_259" id="FNanchor_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">259</a> and opposite to it, Antirrhium.<a name="FNanchor_260" id="FNanchor_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">260</a>
Not long since the Romans, after the victory at Actium,
stationed there a large portion of their army, and at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]<br />[CAS. 387]</a></span>
present it is very well peopled, since it is a colony of the
Romans. It has also a tolerably good shelter for vessels.
Next is Dyme,<a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">261</a> a city without a harbour, the most westerly of
all the cities, whence also it has its name. It was formerly called
Stratos.<a name="FNanchor_262" id="FNanchor_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">262</a> It is separated from Eleia at Buprasium by the
river Larisus,<a name="FNanchor_263" id="FNanchor_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">263</a> which rises in a mountain, called by some persons
Scollis, but by Homer, the Olenian rock.</p>

<p>Antimachus having called Dyme Cauconis, some writers
suppose that the latter word is used as an epithet derived
from the Caucones, who extended as far as this quarter, as I
have said before. Others think that it is derived from a river
Caucon, in the same way as Thebes has the appellation of
Dirc&aelig;an, and Asopian; and as Argos is called Inachian, and
Troy, Simuntis.<a name="FNanchor_264" id="FNanchor_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">264</a></p>

<p>A little before our time, Dyme had received a colony consisting
of a mixed body of people, a remnant of the piratical
bands, whose haunts Pompey had destroyed. Some he settled
at Soli in Cilicia, and others in other places, and some in this
spot.</p>

<p>Phara borders upon the Dym&aelig;an territory. The inhabitants
of this Phara are called Pharenses; those of the Messenian
Phara, Pharat&aelig;. In the territory of Phara there is a
fountain Dirce, of the same name as that at Thebes.</p>

<p>Olenus is deserted. It lies between Patr&aelig; and Dyme.
The territory is occupied by the Dym&aelig;i. Next is Araxus,<a name="FNanchor_265" id="FNanchor_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">265</a>
the promontory of the Eleian district, distant from the isthmus
1000 stadia.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Arcadia</span> is situated in the middle of Peloponnesus, and
contains the greatest portion of the mountainous tract in that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
country. Its largest mountain is Cyllene.<a name="FNanchor_266" id="FNanchor_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">266</a> Its perpendicular
height, according to some writers, is 20, according to others,
about 15 stadia.</p>

<p>The Arcadian nations, as the Azanes, and Parrhasii, and
other similar tribes, seem to be the most ancient people of
Greece.<a name="FNanchor_267" id="FNanchor_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">267</a></p>

<p>In consequence of the complete devastation of this country,
it is unnecessary to give a long description of it. The cities,
although formerly celebrated, have been destroyed by continual
wars; and the husbandmen abandoned the country at
the time that most of the cities were united in that called
Megalopolis (the Great City). At present Megalopolis itself
has undergone the fate expressed by the comic poet;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;the great city is a great desert.&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>There are rich pastures for cattle, and particularly for horses
and asses, which are used as stallions. The race of Arcadian
horses, as well as the Argolic and Epidaurian, is preferred
before all others. The uninhabited tracts of country in &AElig;tolia
and Acarnania are not less adapted to the breeding of horses
than Thessaly.</p>

<p>2. Mantinea owes its fame to Epaminondas, who conquered
the Laced&aelig;monians there in a second battle, in which he lost
his life.<a name="FNanchor_268" id="FNanchor_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">268</a></p>

<p>This city, together with Orchomenus, Her&aelig;a, Cleitor, Pheneus,
Stymphalus, M&aelig;nalus, Methydrium, Caphyeis, and Cyn&aelig;tha,
either exist no longer, or traces and signs only of their
existence are visible. There are still some remains of Tegea,
and the temple of the Al&aelig;an Minerva remains. The latter
is yet held in some little veneration, as well as the temple of
the Lyc&aelig;an Jupiter on the Lyc&aelig;an mountain. But the places
mentioned by the poet, as</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">&#8220;Rhipe, and Stratia, and the windy Enispe,&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>are difficult to discover, and if discovered, would be of no use
from the deserted condition of the country.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]<br />[CAS. 389]</a></span></p>

<p>3. The mountains of note, besides Cyllene, are Pholo&euml;,<a name="FNanchor_269" id="FNanchor_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">269</a> Lyc&aelig;um,<a name="FNanchor_270" id="FNanchor_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">270</a>
M&aelig;nalus, and the Parthenium,<a name="FNanchor_271" id="FNanchor_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">271</a> as it is called, which
extends from the territory of Tegea to that of Argos.</p>

<p>4. We have spoken of the extraordinary circumstances relative
to the Alpheius, Eurotas, and the Erasinus, which
issues out of the lake Stymphalis, and now flows into the
Argive country.</p>

<p>Formerly, the Erasinus had no efflux, for the Berethra,
which the Arcadians call Zerethra,<a name="FNanchor_272" id="FNanchor_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">272</a> had no outlet, so that the
city of the Stymphalii, which at that time was situated upon
the lake, is now at the distance of 50 stadia.</p>

<p>The contrary was the case with the Ladon, which was at
one time prevented running in a continuous stream by the
obstruction of its sources. For the Berethra near Pheneum,
through which it now passes, fell in in consequence of an
earthquake, which stopped the waters of the river, and affected
far down the veins which supplied its source. This
is the account of some writers.</p>

<p>Eratosthenes says, that about the Pheneus, the river called
Anias forms a lake, and then sinks under-ground into certain
openings, which they call Zerethra. When these are obstructed,
the water sometimes overflows into the plains, and
when they are again open the water escapes in a body
from the plains, and is discharged into the Ladon<a name="FNanchor_273" id="FNanchor_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">273</a> and the Alpheius,<a name="FNanchor_274" id="FNanchor_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">274</a>
so that it happened once at Olympia, that the land
about the temple was inundated, but the lake was partly emptied.
The Erasinus<a name="FNanchor_275" id="FNanchor_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">275</a> also, he says, which flows by Stymphalus,
sinks into the ground under the mountain (Chaon?), and reappears
in the Argive territory. It was this that induced
Iphicrates, when besieging Stymphalus, and making no progress,
to attempt to obstruct the descent of the river into the
ground by means of a large quantity of sponges, but desisted
in consequence of some portentous signs in the heavens.</p>

<p>Near the Pheneus there is also the water of the Styx, as it
is called, a dripping spring of poisonous water, which was
esteemed to be sacred.</p>

<p>So much then respecting Arcadia.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>5.<a name="FNanchor_276" id="FNanchor_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">276</a> Polybius having said, that from Male&aelig; towards the north
as far as the Danube the distance is about 10,000 stadia, is corrected
by Artemidorus, and not without reason; for, according
to the latter, from Male&aelig; to &AElig;gium the distance is 1400
stadia, from hence to Cirrha is a distance by sea of 200 stadia;
hence by Heraclea to Thaumaci a journey of 500 stadia;
thence to Larisa and the river Peneus, 340 stadia; then
through Tempe to the mouth of the Peneus, 240 stadia; then
to Thessalonica, 660 stadia; then to the Danube, through
Idomene, and Stobi, and Dardanii, it is 3200 stadia. According
to Artemidorus, therefore, the distance from the
Danube to Male&aelig; would be 6500. The cause of this difference
is that he does not give the measurement by the shortest
road, but by some accidental route pursued by a general of an
army.</p>

<p>It is not, perhaps, out of place to add the founders mentioned
by Ephorus, who settled colonies in Peloponnesus after
the return of the Heracleid&aelig;; as Aletes, the founder of Corinth;
Phalces, of Sicyon; Tisamenus, of cities in Ach&aelig;a; Oxylus,
of Elis, Cresphontes, of Messene; Eurysthenes and Procles,
of Laced&aelig;mon; Temenus and Cissus, of Argos; and
Agr&aelig;us and De&iuml;phontes, of the towns about Acte.</p>

<p class="center f85">SUMMARY.</p>

<p class="center f85">Continuation of the geography of Greece. A panegyrical account of Athens.
A description of B&#339;otia and Thessaly, with the sea-coast.
</p>



<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Having</span> completed the description of Peloponnesus,
which we said was the first and least of the peninsulas of
which Greece consists, we must next proceed to those which
are continuous with it.<a name="FNanchor_277" id="FNanchor_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">277</a></p>

<p>We described the second to be that which joins Megaris
to the Peloponnesus [so that Crommyon belongs to Megaris,
and not to the Corinthians];<a name="FNanchor_278" id="FNanchor_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">278</a> the third to be that which is
situated near the former, comprising Attica and B&#339;otia, some
part of Phocis, and of the Locri Epicnemidii. Of these we
are now to speak.</p>

<p>Eudoxus says, that if we imagine a straight line to be
drawn towards the east from the Ceraunian Mountains to
Sunium, the promontory of Attica, it would leave, on the
right hand, to the south, the whole of Peloponnesus, and on
the left, to the north, the continuous coast from the Ceraunian</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p>Mountains to the Cris&aelig;an Gulf, and the whole of Megaris
and Attica. He is of opinion that the shore which extends
from Sunium to the Isthmus, would not have so great a curvature,
nor have so great a bend, if, to this shore, were not
added the parts continuous with the Isthmus and extending
to the Hermionic Bay and Act&eacute;; that in the same manner
the shore, from the Ceraunian Mountains to the Gulf of
Corinth, has a similar bend, so as to make a curvature, forming
within it a sort of gulf, where Rhium and Antirrhium
contracting together give it this figure. The same is the
case with the shore about Crissa and the recess, where the
Criss&aelig;an Sea terminates.<a name="FNanchor_279" id="FNanchor_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">279</a></p>

<p>2. As this is the description given by Eudoxus, a mathematician,
skilled in the delineations of figures and the inclinations
of places, acquainted also with the places themselves,
we must consider the sides of Attica and Megaris,
extending from Sunium as far as the Isthmus, to be curved,
although slightly so. About the middle of the above-mentioned
line<a name="FNanchor_280" id="FNanchor_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">280</a> is the Pir&aelig;us, the naval arsenal of the Athenians.
It is distant from Sch&#339;nus, at the Isthmus, about 350 stadia;
from Sunium 330. The distance from the Pir&aelig;us to Pag&aelig;<a name="FNanchor_281" id="FNanchor_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">281</a>
and from the Pir&aelig;us to Sch&#339;nus is nearly the same, yet the
former is said to exceed the latter by 10 stadia. After having
doubled Sunium, the navigation along the coast is to the
north with a declination to the west.</p>

<p>3. Acte (Attica) is washed by two seas; it is at first
narrow, then it widens towards the middle, yet it, nevertheless,
takes a lunated bend towards Oropus in B&#339;otia, having
the convex side towards the sea. This is the second, the
eastern side of Attica.</p>

<p>The remaining side is that to the north, extending from
the territory of Oropus towards the west, as far as Megaris,
and consists of the mountainous tract of Attica, having a
variety of names, and dividing B&#339;otia from Attica; so that,
as I have before remarked, B&#339;otia, by being connected with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]<br />[CAS. 391]</a></span>
two seas, becomes the Isthmus of the third peninsula, which
we have mentioned before, and this Isthmus includes within
it the Peloponnesus, Megaris, and Attica. For this reason
therefore the present Attica was called by a play upon the
words Acta and Actica, because the greatest part of it lies
under the mountains, and borders on the sea; it is narrow,
and stretches forwards a considerable length as far as Sunium.
We shall therefore resume the description of these
sides, beginning from the sea-coast, at the point where we
left off.</p>

<p>4. After Crommyon, rising above Attica, are the rocks
called Scironides, which afford no passage along the sea-side.
Over them, however, is a road which leads to Megara and
Attica from the Isthmus. The road approaches so near the
rocks that in many places it runs along the edge of precipices,
for the overhanging mountain is of great height, and impassable.</p>

<p>Here is laid the scene of the fable of Sciron, and the
Pityocamptes, or the pine-breaker, one of those who infested
with their robberies the above-mentioned mountainous tract.
They were slain by Theseus.</p>

<p>The wind Argestes,<a name="FNanchor_282" id="FNanchor_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">282</a> which blows from the left with
violence, from these summits is called by the Athenians
Sciron.</p>

<p>After the rocks Scironides there projects the promontory
Minoa, forming the harbour of Nis&aelig;a. Nis&aelig;a is the arsenal
of Megara, and distant 18 stadia from the city; it is joined
to it by walls on each side.<a name="FNanchor_283" id="FNanchor_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">283</a> This also had the name of
Minoa.</p>

<p>5. In former times the Ionians occupied this country, and
were also in possession of Attica, before the time of the
building of Megara, wherefore the poet does not mention
these places by any appropriate name, but when he calls all
those dwelling in Attica, Athenians, he comprehends these
also in the common appellation, regarding them as Athenians;
so when, in the Catalogue of the Ships, he says,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">&#8220;And they who occupied Athens, a well-built city,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_284" id="FNanchor_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">284</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>we must understand the present Megarenses also, as having
taken a part in the expedition. The proof of this is, that
Attica was, in former times, called Ionia, and Ias, and when
the poet says,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">&#8220;There the B&#339;oti, Iaones,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_285" id="FNanchor_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">285</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>he means the Athenians. But of this Ionia Megaris was a
part.</p>

<p>6. Besides, the Peloponnesians and Ionians having had frequent
disputes respecting their boundaries, on which Crommyonia
also was situated, assembled and agreed upon a spot
of the Isthmus itself, on which they erected a pillar having
an inscription on the part towards Peloponnesus,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line"><span class="smcap"><small>&#8220;this is peloponnesus, not ionia;&#8221;</small></span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>and on the side towards Megara,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line"><span class="smcap"><small>&#8220;this is not peloponnesus, but ionia.&#8221;</small></span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Although those, who wrote on the history of Attica,<a name="FNanchor_286" id="FNanchor_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">286</a> differ
in many respects, yet those of any note agree in this, that
when there were four Pandionid&aelig;, &AElig;geus, Lycus, Pallas,
and Nisus; and when Attica was divided into four portions,
Nisus obtained, by lot, Megaris, and founded Nis&aelig;a.
Philochorus says, that his government extended from the
Isthmus to Pythium,<a name="FNanchor_287" id="FNanchor_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">287</a> but according to Andron, as far as
Eleusis and the Thriasian plain.</p>

<p>Since, then, different writers give different accounts of the
division of the country into four parts, it is enough to adduce
these lines from Sophocles where &AElig;geus says,</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;My father determined that I should go away to Acte, having assigned
to me, as the elder, the best part of the land; to Lycus, the opposite garden
of Eub&#339;a; for Nisus he selects the irregular tract of the shore of
Sciron; and the rugged Pallas, breeder of giants, obtained by lot the part
to the south.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_288" id="FNanchor_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">288</a></p>

<p>Such are the proofs which are adduced to show that Megaris
was a part of Attica.</p>

<p>7. After the return of the Heraclid&aelig;, and the partition of
the country, many of the former possessors were banished from
their own land by the Heraclid&aelig;, and by the Dorians, who
came with them, and migrated to Attica. Among these was
Melanthus, the king of Messene. He was voluntarily appointed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]<br />[CAS. 393]</a></span>
king of the Athenians, after having overcome in
single combat, Xanthus, the king of the B&#339;otians. When
Attica became populous by the accession of fugitives, the
Heraclid&aelig; were alarmed, and invaded Attica, chiefly at the
instigation of the Corinthians and Messenians; the former
of whom were influenced by proximity of situation, the latter
by the circumstance that Codrus, the son of Melanthus, was
at that time king of Attica. They were, however, defeated
in battle and relinquished the whole of the country, except
the territory of Megara, of which they kept possession, and
founded the city Megara, where they introduced as inhabitants
Dorians in place of Ionians. They destroyed the pillar
also which was the boundary of the country of the Ionians
and the Peloponnesians.</p>

<p>8. The city of the Megarenses, after having experienced
many changes, still subsists. It once had schools of philosophers,
who had the name of the Megaric sect. They succeeded
Euclides, the Socratic philosopher, who was by birth a
Megarensian, in the same manner as the Eleiaci, among whom
was Pyrrhon, who succeeded Ph&aelig;don, the Eleian, who was also
a Socratic philosopher, and as the Eretriaci succeeded Menedemus
the Eretrean.</p>

<p>Megaris, like Attica, is very sterile, and the greater part of
it is occupied by what are called the Oneii mountains, a kind
of ridge, which, extending from the Scironides rocks to B&#339;otia
and to Cith&aelig;ron, separates the sea at Nis&aelig;a from that near
Pag&aelig;, called the Alcyonian Sea.</p>

<p>9. In sailing from Nis&aelig;a to Attica there lie, in the course
of the voyage, five small islands. Then succeeds Salamis,
which is about 70, and according to others, 80, stadia in
length. It has two cities of the same name. The ancient
city, which looked towards &AElig;gina and to the south, as
&AElig;schylus has described it;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">&#8220;&AElig;gina lies towards the blasts of the south:&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>it is uninhabited. The other is situated in a bay on a spot of a
peninsular form contiguous to Attica. In former times it
had other names, for it was called Sciras, and Cychreia, from
certain heroes; from the former Minerva is called Sciras;
hence also Scira, a place in Attica; Episcirosis, a religious
rite; and Scirophorion, one of the months. From Cychreia
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
the serpent Cychrides had its name, which Hesiod says
Cychreus bred, and Eurylochus ejected, because it infested
the island, but that Ceres admitted it into Eleusis, and it became
her attendant. Salamis was called also Pityussa from
&#8220;pitys,&#8221; the pine tree. The island obtained its renown from
the &AElig;acid&aelig;, who were masters of it, particularly from Ajax,
the son of Telamon, and from the defeat of Xerxes by the
Greeks in a battle on the coast, and by his flight to his own
country. The &AElig;ginet&aelig; participated in the glory of that engagement,
both as neighbours, and as having furnished a considerable
naval force. [In Salamis is the river Bocarus, now
called Bocalia.]<a name="FNanchor_289" id="FNanchor_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">289</a></p>

<p>10. At present the Athenians possess the island Salamis.
In former times they disputed the possession of it with the
Megarians. Some allege, that Pisistratus, others that
Solon, inserted in the Catalogue of Ships immediately after
this verse,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">&#8220;Ajax conducted from Salamis twelve vessels,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_290" id="FNanchor_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">290</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>the following words,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">&#8220;And stationed them by the side of the Athenian forces;&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>and appealed to the poet as a witness, that the island originally
belonged to the Athenians. But this is not admitted by
the critics, because many other lines testify the contrary.
For why does Ajax appear at the extremity of the line not
with the Athenians, but with the Thessalians under the command
of Protesilaus;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">&#8220;There were the vessels of Ajax, and Protesilaus.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_291" id="FNanchor_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">291</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>And Agamemnon, in the Review<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> of the troops,</p>

<p>and again, respecting Ajax and the Salaminii;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">&#8220;he came to the Ajaces,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_293" id="FNanchor_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">293</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>and near them,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">&#8220;Idomeneus on the other side amidst the Cretans,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_294" id="FNanchor_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">294</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>not Menestheus. The Athenians then seem to have alleged
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84<br />[CAS. 394]</a></span>
some such evidence as this from Homer as a pretext, and the
Megarians to have replied in an opposite strain of this kind;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;Ajax conducted ships from Salamis, from Polichna, from &AElig;girussa,
from Nis&aelig;a, and from Tripodes,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_295" id="FNanchor_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">295</a></p>

<p>which are places in Megaris, of which Tripodes has the name
of Tripodiscium, situated near the present forum of Megara.</p>

<p>11. Some say, that Salamis is unconnected with Attica, because
the priestess of Minerva Polias, who may not eat the
new cheese of Attica, but the produce only of a foreign
land, yet uses the Salaminian cheese. But this is a mistake,
for she uses that which is brought from other islands,
that are confessedly near Attica, for the authors of this
custom considered all produce as foreign which was brought
over sea.</p>

<p>It seems as if anciently the present Salamis was a separate
state, and that Megara was a part of Attica.</p>

<p>On the sea-coast, opposite to Salamis, the boundaries of
Megara and Attica are two mountains called Cerata, or
Horns.<a name="FNanchor_296" id="FNanchor_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">296</a></p>

<p>12. Next is the city Eleusis,<a name="FNanchor_297" id="FNanchor_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">297</a> in which is the temple of the
Eleusinian Ceres, and the Mystic Enclosure (Secos),<a name="FNanchor_298" id="FNanchor_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">298</a> which
Ictinus built,<a name="FNanchor_299" id="FNanchor_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">299</a> capable of containing the crowd of a theatre.
It was this person that built<a name="FNanchor_300" id="FNanchor_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">300</a> the Parthenon in the Acropolis,
in honour of Minerva, when Pericles was the superintendent
of the public works. The city is enumerated among the
demi, or burghs.</p>

<p>13. Then follows the Thriasian plain, and the coast, a
demus of the same name,<a name="FNanchor_301" id="FNanchor_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">301</a> then the promontory Amphiale,<a name="FNanchor_302" id="FNanchor_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">302</a>
above which is a stone quarry; and then the passage across
the sea to Salamis, of about 2 stadia, which Xerxes endeavoured
to fill up with heaps of earth, but the sea-fight
and the flight of the Persians occurred before he had accomplished
it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>There also are the Pharmacuss&aelig;,<a name="FNanchor_303" id="FNanchor_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">303</a> two small islands, in the
larger of which is shown the tomb of Circe.</p>

<p>14. Above this coast is a mountain called Corydallus, and
the demus Corydalleis: then the harbour of Phoron, (Robbers,)
and Psyttalia, a small rocky desert island, which, according to
some writers, is the eye-sore of the Pir&aelig;us.</p>

<p>Near it is Atalanta, of the same name as that between
Eub&#339;a and the Locri; and another small island similar to
Psyttalia; then the Pir&aelig;us, which is also reckoned among the
demi, and the Munychia.</p>

<p>15. The Munychia is a hill in the shape of a peninsula,
hollow, and a great part of it excavated both by nature and
art, so as to serve for dwellings, with an entrance by a narrow
opening. Beneath it are three harbours. Formerly the
Munychia was surrounded by a wall, and occupied by dwellings,
nearly in the same manner as the city of the Rhodians,
comprehending within the circuit of the walls the Pir&aelig;us and
the harbours full of materials for ship-building; here also
was the armoury, the work of Philon. The naval station
was capable of receiving the four hundred vessels; which
was the smallest number the Athenians were in the habit of
keeping in readiness for sea. With this wall were connected
the legs, that stretched out from the Asty. These were the
long walls, 40 stadia in length, joining the Asty<a name="FNanchor_304" id="FNanchor_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">304</a> to the
Pir&aelig;us. But in consequence of frequent wars, the wall and
the fortification of the Munychia were demolished; the
Pir&aelig;us was contracted to a small town, extending round the
harbours and the temple of Jupiter Soter. The small porticoes
of the temple contain admirable paintings, the work of
celebrated artists, and the hyp&aelig;thrum, statues. The long
walls also were destroyed, first demolished by the Laced&aelig;monians,
and afterwards by the Romans, when Sylla took the
Pir&aelig;us and the Asty by siege.<a name="FNanchor_305" id="FNanchor_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">305</a></p>

<p>16. What is properly the Asty is a rock, situated in a
plain, with dwellings around it. Upon the rock is the temple
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]<br />[CAS. 396]</a></span>
of Minerva, and the ancient shrine of Minerva Polias, in
which is the never-extinguished lamp; and the Parthenon,
built by Ictinus, in which is the Minerva, in ivory, the work
of Pheidias.</p>

<p>When, however, I consider the multitude of objects, so
celebrated and far-famed, belonging to this city, I am reluctant
to enlarge upon them, lest what I write should depart
too far from the proposed design of this work.<a name="FNanchor_306" id="FNanchor_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">306</a> For the
words of Hegesias<a name="FNanchor_307" id="FNanchor_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">307</a> occur to me;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;I behold the acropolis, there is the symbol of the great trident;<a name="FNanchor_308" id="FNanchor_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">308</a> I see
Eleusis; I am initiated in the sacred mysteries; that is Leocorium;<a name="FNanchor_309" id="FNanchor_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">309</a> this
the Theseium.<a name="FNanchor_310" id="FNanchor_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">310</a> To describe all is beyond my power, for Attica is the
chosen residence of the gods; and the possession of heroes its progenitors.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yet this very writer mentions only one of the remarkable
things to be seen in the Acropolis. Polemo Periegetes<a name="FNanchor_311" id="FNanchor_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">311</a> however
composed four books on the subject of the sacred offerings
which were there. Hegesias is similarly sparing of
remarks on other parts of the city, and of the territory: after
speaking of Eleusis, one of the hundred and seventy demi, to
which as they say four are to be added, he mentions no other
by name.</p>

<p>17. Many, if not all the demi, have various fabulous tales
and histories connected with them: with Aphidna is connected
the rape of Helen by Theseus, the sack of the place by
the Dioscuri, and the recovery of their sister; with Marathon,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
the battle with the Persians; at Rhamnus was the
statue of Nemesis, which, according to some writers, is the
work of Diodotus, according to others, of Agoracritus, the
Parian, so well executed, both as to size and beauty, as to
rival the art of Pheidias. Deceleia was the rendezvous of the
Peloponnesians in the Decelic war. From Phyle Thrasybulus
brought back the people to the Pir&aelig;us, and thence to the
Asty. Thus also much might be told respecting many other
places; the Leocorium, the Theseium, and the Lyceum have
their own fables, and the Olympicum, called also the Olympium,
which the king, who dedicated it, left, at his death,
half finished; so also much might be said of the Academia,
of the gardens of the philosophers, of the Odeium,<a name="FNanchor_312" id="FNanchor_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">312</a> of the
Stoa P&#339;cile, [or painted Portico,] and of the temples in the
city, all of which contain the works of illustrious artists.</p>

<p>18. The account would be much longer if we were to inquire
who were the founders of the city from the time of
Cecrops, for writers do not agree, as is evident from the names
of persons and of places. For example, Attica,<a name="FNanchor_313" id="FNanchor_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">313</a> they say,
was derived from Act&aelig;on; Atthis, and Attica, from Atthis,
the daughter of Cranaus, from whom the inhabitants had the
name Crana&iuml;; Mopsopia from Mopsopus; Ionia from Ion, the
son of Xuthus; Poseidonia and Athen&aelig;, from the deities of
that name. We have said, that the nation of the Pelasgi seem
to have come into this country in the course of their migrations,
and were called from their wanderings, by the Attici,
Pelargi, or storks.</p>

<p>19. In proportion as an earnest desire is excited to ascertain
the truth about remarkable places and events, and in
proportion as writers, on these subjects, are more numerous,
so much the more is an author exposed to censure, who does
not make himself master of what has been written. For example,
in &#8220;the Collection of the Rivers,&#8221; Callimachus says,
that he should laugh at the person, who would venture to
describe the Athenian virgins as</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]<br />[CAS. 397]</a></span></p>

<p class="small">&#8220;drinking of the pure waters of the Eridanus,&#8221;</p>

<p>from which even the herds would turn away. There are
indeed fountains of water, pure and fit for drinking, it is said,
without the gate called Diochares, near the Lyceium; formerly
also a fountain was erected near it, which afforded a large supply
of excellent water; but if it is not so at present, is it at
all strange, that a fountain supplying abundance of pure and
potable water at one period of time, should afterwards have
the property of its waters altered?</p>

<p>In subjects, however, which are so numerous, we cannot
enter into detail; yet they are not so entirely to be passed
over in silence as to abstain from giving a condensed account
of some of them.</p>

<p>20. It will suffice then to add, that, according to Philochorus,
when the country was devastated on the side of the
sea by the Carians, and by land by the B&#339;otians, whom they
called Aones, Cecrops first settled a large body of people in
twelve cities, the names of which were Cecropia, Tetrapolis,
Epacria, Deceleia, Eleusis, Aphidna, (although some persons
write it in the plural number, Aphidn&aelig;,) Thoricus, Brauron,
Cytherus, Sphettus, Cephisia [Phalerus]. Again, at a subsequent
period, Theseus is said to have collected the inhabitants
of the twelve cities into one, the present city.</p>

<p>Formerly, the Athenians were governed by kings; they
afterwards changed the government to a democracy; then
tyrants were their masters, as Pisistratus and his sons; afterwards
there was an oligarchy both of the four hundred and
of the thirty tyrants, whom the Laced&aelig;monii set over them;
these were expelled by the Athenians, who retained the form
of a democracy, till the Romans established their empire.
For, although they were somewhat oppressed by the Macedonian
kings, so as to be compelled to obey them, yet they preserved
entire the same form of government. Some say, that
the government was very well administered during a period
of ten years, at the time that Casander was king of the
Macedonians. For this person, although in other respects
he was disposed to be tyrannical, yet, when he was master of
the city, treated the Athenians with kindness and generosity.
He placed at the head of the citizens Demetrius the Phalerean,
a disciple of Theophrastus the philosopher, who, far from
dissolving, restored the democracy. This appears from his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
memoirs, which he composed concerning this mode of government.
But so much hatred and dislike prevailed against
anything connected with oligarchy, that, after the death of
Casander, he was obliged to fly into Egypt.<a name="FNanchor_314" id="FNanchor_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">314</a> The insurgents
pulled down more than three hundred of his statues, which
were melted down, and according to some were cast into
chamber-pots. The Romans, after their conquest, finding
them governed by a democracy,<a name="FNanchor_315" id="FNanchor_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">315</a> maintained their independence
and liberty. During the Mithridatic war, the king set
over them such tyrants as he pleased. Aristio, who was the
most powerful of these persons, oppressed the city; he was
taken by Sylla, the Roman general, after a siege,<a name="FNanchor_316" id="FNanchor_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">316</a> and put to
death. The citizens were pardoned, and, to this time, the
city enjoys liberty, and is respected by the Romans.</p>

<p>21. Next to the Pir&aelig;us is the demus Phalereis, on the succeeding
line of coast, then Halimusii, &AElig;xoneis, Al&aelig;eis, the
&AElig;xonici, Anagyrasii; then Theoris, Lampesis; &AElig;gilieis,
Anaphlystii, Azenieis; these extend as far as the promontory
Sunium. Between the above-mentioned demi is a long
promontory, Zoster,<a name="FNanchor_317" id="FNanchor_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">317</a> the first after the &AElig;xoneis; then another
promontory after Thoreis, Astypal&aelig;a; in the front of
the former of these is an island, Phabra,<a name="FNanchor_318" id="FNanchor_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">318</a> and of the latter an
island, Ele&uuml;ssa,<a name="FNanchor_319" id="FNanchor_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">319</a> opposite the &AElig;xoneis is Hydrussa. About
Anaphlystum is the Paneum, and the temple of Venus Colias.
Here, they say, were thrown up by the waves the last portions
of the wrecks of the vessels after the naval engagement
with the Persians near Salamis, of which remains Apollo predicted,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;The women of Colias shall shudder at the sight of oars.&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>In front of these places lies off, at no great distance, the island
Belbina; and the rampart of Patroclus; but most of these
islands are uninhabited.</p>

<p>22. On doubling the promontory at Sunium, we meet with
Sunium, a considerable demus; then Thoricus, next a demus
called Potamus, from which the inhabitants are called Potamii;
next Prasia,<a name="FNanchor_320" id="FNanchor_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">320</a> Steiria, Brauron, where is the temple of</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]<br />[CAS. 399]</a></span></p>

<p>Diana Brauronia, Hal&aelig; Araphenides, where is the temple
of Diana Tauropola; then Myrrhinus, Probalinthus, Marathon,
where Miltiades entirely destroyed the army of Datis
the Persian, without waiting for the Laced&aelig;monians, who deferred
setting out till the full moon. There is laid the scene
of the fable of the Marathonian bull, which Theseus killed.</p>

<p>Next to Marathon is Tricorynthus, then Rhamnus, where is
the temple of Nemesis; then Psaphis, a city of the Oropii.
Somewhere about this spot is the Amphiaraeum, an oracle
once in repute, to which Amphiareus fled, as Sophocles says,</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;The dusty Theban soil opened and received him with his armour, and
the four-horse chariot.&#8221;</p>

<p>Oropus has frequently been a subject of contention, for it is
situated on the confines of Attica and B&#339;otia.</p>

<p>In front of this coast, before Thoricum and Sunium, is
the island Helena; it is rocky and uninhabited, extending in
length about 60 stadia, which, they say, the poet mentions in
the words, in which Alexander addresses Helen,</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;Not when first I carried thee away from the pleasant Laced&aelig;mon,
across the deep, and in the island Crana&euml; embraced thee.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_321" id="FNanchor_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">321</a></p>

<p>For Crana&euml;, from the kind of intercourse which took place
there, is now called Helena. Next to Helena,<a name="FNanchor_322" id="FNanchor_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">322</a> Eub&#339;a<a name="FNanchor_323" id="FNanchor_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">323</a>
lies in front of the following tract of coast. It is long and
narrow, and stretching along the continent like Helena.
From Sunium to the southern point of Eub&#339;a, which is called
Leuce Acte,<a name="FNanchor_324" id="FNanchor_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">324</a> [or, the white coast,] is a voyage of 300 stadia,
but we shall speak hereafter of Eub&#339;a.</p>

<p>It would be tedious to recite the names of the Demi of
Attica in the inland parts, on account of their number.<a name="FNanchor_325" id="FNanchor_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">325</a></p>

<p>23. Among the mountains which are most celebrated, are
the Hymettus, Brilessus, Lycabettus, Parnes, and Corydallus.<a name="FNanchor_326" id="FNanchor_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">326</a>
Near the city are excellent quarries of Hymettian and Pentelic
marble. The Hymettus produces also the finest honey.
The silver mines in Attica were at first of importance, but
are now exhausted. The workmen, when the mines yielded
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
a bad return to their labour, committed to the furnace the old
refuse and scoria, and hence obtained very pure silver, for
the former workmen had carried on the process in the furnace
unskilfully.</p>

<p>Although the Attic is the best of all the kinds of honey,
yet by far the best of the Attic honey is that found in the
country of the silver mines,<a name="FNanchor_327" id="FNanchor_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">327</a> which they call acapniston, or unsmoked,
from the mode of its preparation.</p>

<p>24. Among the rivers is the Cephissus, having its source
from the Trinemeis, it flows through the plain (where are the
Gephyra, and the Gephyrismi) between the legs or walls extending
from the Asty to the Pir&aelig;us, and empties itself into
the Phalericum. Its character is chiefly that of a winter
torrent, for in the summer time it fails altogether. Such
also, for the most part, is the Ilissus, which flows from the
other side of the Asty to the same coast, from the parts above
Agra, and the Lyceium, and the fountain celebrated by Plato
in the Ph&aelig;drus. So much then respecting Attica.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Next</span> in order is B&#339;otia. When I speak of this country,
and of the contiguous nations, I must, for the sake of perspicuity,
repeat what I have said before.</p>

<p>We have said, that the sea-coast stretches from Sunium to
the north as far as Thessalonica, inclining a little toward the
west, and having the sea on the east, that parts situated above
this shore towards the west extend like belts<a name="FNanchor_328" id="FNanchor_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">328</a> parallel to one
another through the whole country. The first of these belts
is Attica with Megaris, the eastern side of which extends
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]<br />[CAS. 400]</a></span>
from Sunium to Oropus, and B&#339;otia; on the western side is
the isthmus, and the Alcyonian sea commencing at Pag&aelig; and
extending as far as the boundaries of B&#339;otia near Creusa,
the remaining two sides are formed by the sea-shore from
Sunium to the Isthmus, and the mountain tract nearly parallel
with this, which separates Attica from B&#339;otia.</p>

<p>The second belt is B&#339;otia, stretching from east to west
from the Eub&#339;an sea to the Cris&aelig;an Gulf, nearly of equal
length with Attica, or perhaps somewhat less; in quality of
soil however it greatly surpasses Attica.</p>

<p>2. Ephorus declares the superiority of B&#339;otia over the
bordering nations not only in this respect, but also because it
alone has three seas adjoining it, and a great number of
harbours. At the Cris&aelig;an and Corinthian Gulfs it received
the commodities of Italy, Sicily, and Africa. Towards Eub&#339;a
the sea-coast branches off on each side of the Euripus;
in one direction towards Aulis and Tanagrica, in the other,
to Salganeus and Anthedon; on one side there is an open
sea to Egypt, and Cyprus, and the islands; on the other to
Macedonia, the Propontis, and the Hellespont. He adds also
that Eub&#339;a is almost a part of B&#339;otia, because the Euripus is
very narrow, and the opposite shores are brought into communication
by a bridge of two plethra in length.<a name="FNanchor_329" id="FNanchor_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">329</a></p>

<p>For these reasons he praises the country, and says, that it
has natural advantages for obtaining supreme command, but
that from want of careful education and learning, even those
who were from time to time at the head of affairs did not long
maintain the ascendency they had acquired, as appears from
the example of Epaminondas; at his death the Thebans immediately
lost the supremacy they had just acquired. This is
to be attributed, says Ephorus, to their neglect of learning, and
of intercourse with mankind, and to their exclusive cultivation
of military virtues. It must be added also, that learning
and knowledge are peculiarly useful in dealing with Greeks,
but in the case of Barbarians, force is preferable to reason. In
fact the Romans in early times, when carrying on war with
savage nations, did not require such accomplishments, but
from the time that they began to be concerned in transactions
with more civilized people, they applied themselves to
learning, and so established universal dominion.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>3. B&#339;otia was first occupied by Barbarians, Aones, and
Temmices, a wandering people from Sunium, by Leleges, and
Hyantes. Then the Ph&#339;nicians, who accompanied Cadmus,
possessed it. He fortified the Cadmeian land, and transmitted
the government to his descendants. The Ph&#339;nicians
founded Thebes, and added it to the Cadmeian territory. They
preserved their dominion, and exercised it over the greatest
part of the B&#339;otians till the time of the expedition of the
Epigoni. At this period they abandoned Thebes for a short
time, but returned again. In the same manner when they
were ejected by Thracians and Pelasgi, they established their
rule in Thessaly together with the Arn&aelig;i for a long period,
so that all the inhabitants obtained the name of B&#339;otians.
They returned afterwards to their own country, at the time
the &AElig;olian expedition was preparing at Aulis in B&#339;otia
which the descendants of Orestes were equipping for Asia.
After having united the Orchomenian tract to B&#339;otia (for
formerly they did not form one community, nor has Homer
enumerated these people with the B&#339;otians, but by themselves,
calling them Miny&aelig;) with the assistance of the Orchomenians
they drove out the Pelasgi, who went to Athens, a
part of which city is called from this people Pelasgic. The
Pelasgi however settled below Hymettus. The Thracians
retreated to Parnassus. The Hyantes founded Hyampolis in
Phocis.</p>

<p>4. Ephorus relates that the Thracians, after making treaty
with the B&#339;otians, attacked them by night, when encamped
in a careless manner during a time of peace. The Thracians
when reproached, and accused of breaking the treaty, replied,
that they had not broken it, for the conditions were &#8220;by
day,&#8221; whereas they had made the attack by night, whence
the common proverb, &#8220;a Thracian shuffle.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Pelasgi and the B&#339;otians also went during the war to
consult the oracle. He cannot tell, he says, what answer was
given to the Pelasgi, but the prophetess replied to the B&#339;otians
that they would prosper by committing some act of
impiety. The messengers sent to consult the oracle suspecting
the prophetess of favouring the Pelasgi on account of their
relationship, (for the temple had originally belonged to the
Pelasgi,) seized the woman, and threw her upon a burning
pile, considering, that whether her conduct had been right or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]<br />[CAS. 402]</a></span>
wrong, in either case they were right; for if she had uttered
a deceitful answer she was duly punished; but if not, they
had only complied with the command of the oracle. Those
in charge of the temple did not like to put to death, particularly
in the temple, the perpetrators of this act without a
formal judgment, and therefore subjected them to a trial.
They were summoned before the priestesses, who were also the
prophetesses, being the two survivors out of the three. The
B&#339;otians alleged that there was no law permitting women to
act as judges; an equal number of men were therefore chosen.
The men acquitted; the women condemned. As the votes
were equal, those for acquittal prevailed. Hence at Dodona
it is to the B&#339;otians only that men deliver oracles. The
prophetesses however give a different meaning to the answer
of the oracle, and say, that the god enjoins the B&#339;otians to
steal the tripods used at home, and to send them annually to
Dodona. This they did, for they were in the habit of carrying
away by night some of the dedicated tripods, which they
concealed in their clothes, in order to convey them clandestinely
as offerings to Dodona.</p>

<p>5. After this they assisted Penthilus in sending out the
&AElig;olian colony, and despatched a large body of their own people
with him, so that it was called the B&#339;otian colony.</p>

<p>A long time afterwards the country was devastated during
the war with the Persians at Plat&aelig;&aelig;. They afterwards so
far recovered their power, that the Thebans, having vanquished
the Laced&aelig;monians in two battles,<a name="FNanchor_330" id="FNanchor_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">330</a> disputed the sovereignty
of Greece. Epaminondas, however, was killed, and
they were disappointed in their hope of obtaining this supremacy.
They, nevertheless, fought in defence of the Greeks
against the Phoc&aelig;ans, who had plundered their common temple.
Reduced by this war, and by the Macedonians, at the
time they invaded Greece, they lost their city, which was
afterwards restored to them, and rebuilt by the Macedonians
themselves, who had razed it.<a name="FNanchor_331" id="FNanchor_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">331</a> From that period to our own
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
times their affairs have continued to decline, nor do they retain
the appearance even of a considerable village. Other cities
(of B&#339;otia) have experienced a similar fate, with the exception
of Tanagra and Thespi&aelig;, which in comparison with
Thebes are in a tolerable condition.</p>

<p>6. We are next to make a circuit of the country, beginning
at the sea-coast, opposite Eub&#339;a, which is continuous with
that of Attica.</p>

<p>We begin this circuit from Oropus, and the Sacred Harbour,<a name="FNanchor_332" id="FNanchor_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">332</a>
which is called Delphinium, opposite to which is the
ancient Eretria in Eub&#339;a, having a passage across of 60
stadia. After Delphinium, at the distance of 20 stadia, is
Oropus, and opposite to this is the present Eretria.<a name="FNanchor_333" id="FNanchor_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">333</a> There
is a passage over to it of 40 stadia.</p>

<p>7. Next is Delium,<a name="FNanchor_334" id="FNanchor_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">334</a> a place sacred to Apollo, in imitation
of that at Delos. It is a small town of the Tanagr&aelig;ans, at
the distance of 30 stadia from Aulis.</p>

<p>To this place the Athenians, after their defeat in battle,
fled in disorder.<a name="FNanchor_335" id="FNanchor_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">335</a> In the flight, Socrates the philosopher
(who having lost his horse, was serving on foot) observed
Xenophon, the son of Gryllus, upon the ground, fallen from
his horse; he raised him upon his shoulders and carried him
away in safety, a distance of many stadia, until the rout was
at an end.</p>

<p>8. Then follows a great harbour, which is called Bathys
(or deep harbour): then Aulis,<a name="FNanchor_336" id="FNanchor_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">336</a> a rocky spot, and a village
of the Tanagr&aelig;ans, with a harbour capable of containing 50
small vessels. So that probably the naval station of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]<br />[CAS. 403]</a></span>
Greeks was in the Great Harbour. Near it is the Chalcidic
Euripus, to which, from Sunium, are 70 stadia. On the
Euripus, as I have already said, there is a bridge of two
plethra in length;<a name="FNanchor_337" id="FNanchor_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">337</a> at each end is a tower, one on the side of
Chalcis, the other on the side of B&#339;otia; and a passage (for
the water) is constructed between them.<a name="FNanchor_338" id="FNanchor_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">338</a> With regard to the
tide of the Euripus, it is sufficient to say thus much, that according
to report, it changes seven times each day and night;
the cause must be investigated elsewhere.</p>

<p>9. Salganeus is a place situated near the Euripus, upon a
height. It has its name from Salganeus, a B&#339;otian, who was
buried there. He was guide to the Persians, when they
sailed into this passage from the Maliac Gulf. It is said,
that he was put to death before they reached the Euripus, by
the commander of the fleet, Megabates, as a traitor, for conducting
the fleet deceitfully into a narrow opening of the sea,
having no outlet. The Barbarian, however, perceived his
mistake, and regretting what he had done, thought him worthy
of burial, because he had been unjustly put to death.</p>

<p>10. Near Oropus<a name="FNanchor_339" id="FNanchor_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">339</a> is a place called Graia, the temple also
of Amphiaraus, and the monument of Narcissus the Eretrian,
surnamed Sigelus, (the Silent,) because passers-by keep silence.
Some say that Graia and Tanagra<a name="FNanchor_340" id="FNanchor_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">340</a> are the same.
The territory of P&#339;mandris, however, is the same as that of
Tanagra. The Tanagr&aelig;ans are also called Gephyr&aelig;ans. The
temple of Amphiaraus was transferred by command of an
oracle to this place from the Thebaic Cnopia.</p>

<p>11. Mycalessus is a village in the Tanagrian district. It
lies upon the road from Thebes to Chalcis. It is called in
the B&#339;otian dialect Mycalettus. Harma, also, an uninhabited
village in the Tanagrian territory, derives its name from the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
chariot (&#7941;&#961;&#956;&#945;) of Amphiaraus, and is a different place from
Harma in Attica, near Phyle,<a name="FNanchor_341" id="FNanchor_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">341</a> a demus of Attica bordering
upon Tanagra. There the proverb originated,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;When it has lightened through Harma,&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The Pytha&iuml;st&aelig;, as they are called, signify, by the order of an
oracle, the occurrence of any lightning when they are looking
in the direction of Harma, and despatch the sacrifice to
Delphi whenever it is observed. They were to keep watch
for three months, and for three days and nights in each month,
at the altar of Jupiter Astrapius, or Dispenser of lightning.
This altar is in the wall, between the Pythium and the Olympium.
Respecting the B&#339;otian Harma, some say, that Amphiaraus
fell in battle out of his chariot, [harma,] near the
spot where his temple now stands, and that the chariot was
drawn empty to the place, which bears the same name
[Harma].<a name="FNanchor_342" id="FNanchor_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">342</a> Others say, that the chariot of Adrastus, in his
flight, was there dashed in pieces, but that he himself escaped
on his horse Areion. According to Philochorus, his life was
preserved by the inhabitants of the village; in consequence
of which they obtained among the Argives the right of citizenship.</p>

<p>12. On going from Thebes to Argos,<a name="FNanchor_343" id="FNanchor_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">343</a> on the left hand is
Tanagra; and [near the road] on the right lies Hyria. Hyria
now belongs to the Tanagrian territory, but formerly to the
Thebais. Here Hyrieus is fabled to have lived, and here is
the scene of the birth of Orion, which Pindar mentions in the
dithyrambics. It is situated near Aulis. Some persons say
that Hysi&aelig; is called Hyria, which belongs to Parasopia, situated
below Cith&aelig;ron, near Erythr&aelig;, in the inland parts; it is
a colony of the Hyrienses, and was founded by Nycteus, the
father of Antiope. There is also in the Argive territory a
village, Hysi&aelig;, the inhabitants of which are called Hysiat&aelig;.
Erythr&aelig; in Ionia is a colony of this Erythr&aelig;.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]<br />[CAS. 405]</a></span></p>

<p>Heleon, a Tanagrian village, has its name from (Hele) the
marshes there.</p>

<p>13. After Salganeus is Anthedon, a city with a harbour,
the last on the B&#339;otian coast towards Eub&#339;a, as the poet
says,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;Anthedon at the extremity.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_344" id="FNanchor_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">344</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>As we proceed a little farther, there are besides two small
towns, belonging to the B&#339;otians, Larymna, near which the
Cephissus discharges its waters; and farther above, Hal&aelig;, of
the same name as the Attic demus. Opposite to this coast is
situated, it is said, &AElig;g&aelig;<a name="FNanchor_345" id="FNanchor_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">345</a> in Eub&#339;a, where is the temple of
the &AElig;g&aelig;an Neptune, of which we have before spoken. There
is a passage across from Anthedon to &AElig;g&aelig; of 120 stadia, and
from the other places much less than this. The temple is
situated upon a lofty hill, where was once a city. Near &AElig;g&aelig;
was Orobi&aelig;.<a name="FNanchor_346" id="FNanchor_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">346</a> In the Anthedonian territory is the mountain
Messapius,<a name="FNanchor_347" id="FNanchor_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">347</a> which has its name from Messapus, who when he
came into Iapygia called it Messapia. Here is laid the scene
of the fable respecting the Anthedonian Glaucus, who, it is
said, was transformed into a sea-monster.<a name="FNanchor_348" id="FNanchor_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">348</a></p>

<p>14. Near Anthedon is a place called Isus, and esteemed
sacred, belonging to B&#339;otia; it contains remains of a city, and

<p>Nysa is a village of Helicon.</p>

<p>Such then is the description of the sea-coast opposite
Eub&#339;a.</p>

<p>15. The places next in order, in the inland parts, are
hollow plains, surrounded everywhere on the east and west by
mountains; on the south by the mountains of Attica, on the
north by those of Phocis: on the west, Cith&aelig;ron inclines, obliquely,
a little above the Cris&aelig;an Sea; it begins contiguous
to the mountains of Megaris and Attica, and then makes a
bend towards the plains, and terminates near the Theban
territory.</p>

<p>16. Some of these plains become lakes, by rivers spreading
over or falling into them and then flowing off. Some are
dried up, and being very fertile, are cultivated in every possible
way. But as the ground underneath is full of caverns
and fissures, it has frequently happened, that violent earthquakes
have obstructed some passages, and formed others under-ground,
or on the surface, the water being carried off,
either by subterranean channels, or by the formation of lakes
and rivers on the surface. If the deep subterranean passages
are stopped up, the waters of the lakes increase, so as to inundate
and cover cities and whole districts, which become uncovered,
if the same or other passages are again opened. The
same regions are thus traversed in boats or on foot, according
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]<br />[CAS. 406]</a></span>
to circumstances; and the same cities are, occasionally, on the
borders of, or at a distance from, a lake.</p>

<p>17. One of two things took place. The cities either retained
their sites, when the rise of the water was insufficient
to overflow the houses, or they were deserted and rebuilt in
some other place, when the inhabitants, being frequently exposed
to danger from their vicinity to the lake, released themselves
from further apprehension, by changing to a more
distant or higher situation. It followed that the cities thus
rebuilt retained the same name. Formerly, they might have
had a name derived from some accidental local circumstance,
but now the site does not correspond with the derivation of
the name. For example, it is probable that Plat&aelig;&aelig; was so
called, from &#960;&#955;&#8049;&#964;&#951;, or the flat part of the oar, and Plat&aelig;ans
from gaining their livelihood by rowing; but at present,
since they live at a distance from the lake, the name can no
longer, with equal propriety, be derived from this local circumstance.
Helos also, and Heleon, and Heilesium<a name="FNanchor_350" id="FNanchor_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">350</a> were so
called from their situation close to &#7957;&#955;&#951;, (Hele,) or marshes;
but at present the case is different with all these places; either
they have been rebuilt, or the lake has been greatly reduced
in height by a subsequent efflux of its waters; for this is possible.</p>

<p>18. This is exemplified particularly in the Cephissus,<a name="FNanchor_351" id="FNanchor_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">351</a>
which fills the lake Copais.<a name="FNanchor_352" id="FNanchor_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">352</a> When the increase of the water
of that lake was so great, that Cop&aelig; was in danger of being
swallowed up, (the city is mentioned by the poet, and from it
the lake had its name,)<a name="FNanchor_353" id="FNanchor_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">353</a> a fissure in the ground, which took
place not far from the lake, and near Cop&aelig;, opened a subterraneous
channel, of about 30 stadia in length, and received the
river, which reappeared on the surface, near Upper Larymna
in Locris; for, as has been mentioned, there is another Larymna,
in B&#339;otia, on the sea, surnamed the Upper by the Romans.
The place where the river rises again is called Ancho&euml;, as
also the lake near it. It is from this point that the Cephissus
begins its course<a name="FNanchor_354" id="FNanchor_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">354</a> to the sea. When the overflowing of the
water ceased, there was also a cessation of danger to the inhabitants
on the banks, but not before some cities had been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
already swallowed up. When the outlets were again obstructed,
Crates the Miner, a man of Chalcis, began to clear
away the obstructions, but desisted in consequence of the B&#339;otians
being in a state of insurrection; although, as he himself
says, in the letter to Alexander, many places had been already
drained; among these, some writers supposed was the site of
the ancient Orchomenus; others, that of Eleusis, and of
Athens on the Triton. These cities are said to have been
founded by Cecrops, when he ruled over B&#339;otia, then called
Ogygia, but that they were afterwards destroyed by inundations.
It is said, that there was a fissure in the earth near
Orchomenus, that admitted the river Melas,<a name="FNanchor_355" id="FNanchor_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">355</a> which flows
through the territory of Haliartus, and forms there a marsh,
where the reed grows of which the musical pipe is made.<a name="FNanchor_356" id="FNanchor_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">356</a>
But this river has entirely disappeared, being carried off by
the subterraneous channels of the chasm, or absorbed by the
lakes and marshes about Haliartus; whence the poet calls
Haliartus grassy,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>19. These rivers descend from the Phocian mountains, and
among them the Cephissus,<a name="FNanchor_358" id="FNanchor_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">358</a> having its source at Lil&aelig;a, a
Phocian city, as Homer describes it;</p>

Phocians, through the Parapotamii, and the Phanoteis, which
are also Phocian towns; it then goes onwards to Ch&aelig;roneia
in B&#339;otia; afterwards, it traverses the districts of Orchomenus
and Coroneia, and discharges its waters into the lake
Copais. The Permessus and the Olmeius<a name="FNanchor_361" id="FNanchor_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">361</a> descend from Helicon,
and uniting their streams, fall into the lake Copais
near Haliartus. The waters of other streams likewise discharge
themselves into it. It is a large lake with a circuit
of 380 stadia;<a name="FNanchor_362" id="FNanchor_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">362</a> the outlets are nowhere visible, if we

marshes.</p>

<p>20. Among the neighbouring lakes are Trephea<a name="FNanchor_363" id="FNanchor_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">363</a> and Cephissis.

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
which the places stand, and thence it would be easy to perceive
that the poet, when naming them, whether they were places of
importance or otherwise, has observed no order. Indeed it
would be difficult in the enumeration of so many places, obscure
for the most part, and situated in the interior, to preserve a
regular order. The sea-coast affords more convenient means
of doing this; the places there are better known, and the sea
affords greater facilities for marking their position. We shall
therefore endeavour to take our point of departure from the
sea-coast, and without further discussion, shall follow the poet
in his enumeration of places; at the same time, taking from
other sources whatever may prove useful to us, but which
has been omitted by him. He begins from Hyria and Aulis,
of which we have already spoken.</p>

<p>22. Sch&#339;nus<a name="FNanchor_371" id="FNanchor_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">371</a> is a district of the Theban territory on the
road to Anthedon, distant from Thebes about 50 stadia. A
river of the name of Sch&#339;nus flows through it.</p>

<p>23. Scolus<a name="FNanchor_372" id="FNanchor_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">372</a> is a village belonging to the district of Parasopia
situated at the foot of Cith&aelig;ron; it is a rugged place, and
scarcely habitable, hence the proverbial saying,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;Neither go yourself, nor follow any one going to Scolus.&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>It is said that Pentheus was brought from thence, and torn in
pieces. There was among the cities near Olynthus another of
the name of Scolus. We have said that in the Heracleian
Trachinia there was a village of the name of Parasopii, beside
which runs a river Asopus, and that there is another river
Asopus in Sicyonia, and that the country through which it
flows is called Asopia. There are however other rivers of
the same name.</p>

<p>24. The name of Eteonus was changed to that of Scarphe,
which belongs to Parasopia. [Parasopia belongs to the
Thebais,] for the Asopus and the Ismenus flow through the
plain in front of Thebes. There is the fountain Dirce, and
also Potni&aelig;, where is laid the fable of Glaucus of Potni&aelig;,
who was torn in pieces near the city by Potnian mares. The
Cith&aelig;ron<a name="FNanchor_373" id="FNanchor_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">373</a> terminates not far from Thebes. The Asopus
flows by it, and washes the foot of the mountain, and occasions
the Parasopii to be distributed among several settlements,
but all of these bodies of people are subject to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]<br />[CAS. 409]</a></span>
Thebans. (Other writers say, that Scolus, Eteonus, and
Erythr&aelig;, are in the district of Plat&aelig;&aelig;, for the Asopus flows
past Plat&aelig;&aelig;, and discharges its waters into the sea near Tanagra.)
In the Theban territory are Therapn&aelig; and Teumessus,
which Antimachus has extolled in a long poem, enumerating
excellencies which it had not;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

&#8220;There is a small hill exposed to the winds,&#8221; &amp;c.:</div>

<p>but the lines are well known.</p>

<p>25. He calls the present place Thespi&aelig;<a name="FNanchor_374" id="FNanchor_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">374</a> by the name of
Thespia, for there are many names, of which some are used
both in the singular and in the plural number, in the
masculine and in the feminine gender, and some in either one
or the other only. It is a city close to Helicon, lying more
to the south. The city itself and Helicon are situated on the
Cris&aelig;an Gulf. Thespi&aelig; has an arsenal Creusa, or, as it is
also named, Creusia. In the Thespian territory, in the part
lying towards Helicon, is Ascra,<a name="FNanchor_375" id="FNanchor_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">375</a> the birth-place of Hesiod.
It is on the right of Helicon, situated upon a lofty and rocky
spot, at the distance of about 40 stadia from Thespi&aelig;. Hesiod
has satirized it in verses addressed to his father, for formerly
emigrating (to this place) from Cume in &AElig;tolia, as follows:</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;He dwelt near Helicon in a wretched village, Ascra; bad in winter, in
summer intolerable, and worthless at any season.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_376" id="FNanchor_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">376</a></p>

<p>Helicon is contiguous to Phocis on its northern, and partly
on its western side, as far as the last harbour of Phocis, which
is called from its characteristic situation, Mychus, or the
Recess.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>Just above this part of the Cris&aelig;an Gulf, Helicon, Ascra,
Thespi&aelig;, and its arsenal Creusa, are situated. This is
considered as the part of the Cris&aelig;an and of the Corinthian
Gulf which recedes most inland. The coast extends 90 stadia
from the recess of the harbour to Creusa, and thence 120 as
far as the promontory called Holmi&aelig;. In the most retired
part of the Cris&aelig;an Gulf, Pag&aelig; and &#338;noa, which I have
already mentioned, are situated.</p>

<p>Helicon, not far distant from Parnassus, rivals it in height<a name="FNanchor_377" id="FNanchor_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">377</a>
and circumference. Both mountains are covered with snow,
and are rocky. They do not occupy a circuit of ground of great
extent. There are, the fane of the Muses, the Horse-fountain
Hippocrene,<a name="FNanchor_378" id="FNanchor_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">378</a> and the grottoes of the nymphs, the Leibethrides.
Hence it might be conjectured, that Helicon was consecrated
to the Muses, by Thracians, who dedicated also Pieris, the
Leibethrum, and Pimpleia to the same goddesses. The
Thracians were called Pieres, and since their expulsion, the
Macedonians possess these places.</p>

<p>It has been remarked, that the Thracians, (having expelled
the B&#339;otians by force,) and the Pelasgi, and other barbarous
people, settled in this part of B&#339;otia.</p>

<p>Thespi&aelig; was formerly celebrated for a statue of Cupid by
Praxiteles. Glycera the courtesan, a native of Thespi&aelig;, received
it as a present from the artist, and dedicated it as a
public offering to her fellow-citizens.</p>

<p>Persons formerly used to repair thither to see the Cupid,
where there was nothing else worth seeing. This city, and
Tanagra, alone of the B&#339;otian cities exist at present, while of
others there remain nothing but ruins and names.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]<br />[CAS. 410]</a></span></p>

<p>26. After Thespi&aelig; the poet enumerates Graia and Mycalessus,
of which we have before spoken.</p>

<p>He proceeds as before,</p>


<div class="poetry-container">

<p>Peteon is a village of the Thebais near the road to Anthedon.
Ocalea is midway between Haliartus,<a name="FNanchor_380" id="FNanchor_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">380</a> and Alalcomen&aelig;,<a name="FNanchor_381" id="FNanchor_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">381</a> it is
distant from each 30 stadia. A small river of the same name
flows by it. Medeon, belonging to Phocis, is on the Cris&aelig;an
Gulf, distant from B&#339;otia 160 stadia. The Medeon of B&#339;otia
has its name from that in Phocis. It is near Onchestus,
under the mountain Ph&#339;nicium,<a name="FNanchor_382" id="FNanchor_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">382</a> whence it has the appellation
of Ph&#339;nicis. This mountain is likewise assigned to the
Theban district, but by others to the territories of Haliartus,
as also Medeon and Ocalea.</p>

<p>27. Homer afterwards names,</p>

<p>We have spoken of Cop&aelig;. It lies towards the north on the
lake Copais. The other cities around are, Acr&aelig;phi&aelig;, Ph&#339;nicis,
Onchestus, Haliartus, Ocalea, Alalcomen&aelig;, Tilphusium,
Coroneia. Formerly, the lake had no one general name, but
derived its appellation from every settlement on its banks, as
Copa&iuml;s from Cop&aelig;,<a name="FNanchor_384" id="FNanchor_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">384</a> Haliartis from Haliartus, and other names
from other places, but latterly the whole has been called
Copa&iuml;s, for the lake is remarkable for forming at Cop&aelig; the
deepest hollow. Pindar calls it Cephissis, and places near it,
not far from Haliartus and Alalcomen&aelig;, the fountain Tilphossa,
which flows at the foot of Mount Tilphossius. At the
fountain is the monument of Teiresias, and in the same place
the temple of the Tilphossian Apollo.</p>

<p>28. After Cop&aelig;, the poet mentions Eutresis, a small village
of the Thespians.<a name="FNanchor_385" id="FNanchor_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">385</a> Here Zethus and Amphion lived before
they became kings of Thebes.</p>

<p>Thisb&#275; is now called Thisb&aelig;. The place is situated a little
above the sea-coast on the confines of the Thespienses, and
the territory of Coroneia; on the south it lies at the foot of
Cith&aelig;ron. It has an arsenal in a rocky situation abounding
with doves, whence the poet terms it</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;Thisbe, with its flights of doves.&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Thence to Sicyon is a voyage of 160 stadia.</p>

<p>29. He next recites the names of Coroneia, Haliartus, Plat&aelig;&aelig;,
and Glissas.</p>

<p>Coroneia<a name="FNanchor_386" id="FNanchor_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">386</a> is situated upon an eminence, near Helicon. The
B&#339;otians took possession of it on their return from the Thessalian
Arne, after the Trojan war, when they also occupied
Orchomenus. Having become masters of Coroneia, they built
in the plain before the city the temple of the Itonian Minerva,
of the same name as that in Thessaly, and called the river
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]<br />[CAS. 411]</a></span>
flowing by it, Cuarius, the name of the Thessalian river.
Alc&aelig;us, however, calls it Coralius in these words,</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;Minerva, warrior queen, who o&#8217;er Coroneia keepest watch before thy
temple, on the banks of Coralius.&#8221;</p>

<p>The festival Pamb&#339;otia was here celebrated. Hades is associated
with Minerva, in the dedication of the temple, for some
mystical reason. The inhabitants of the B&#339;otian Coroneia
are called Coronii, those of the Messenian Coroneia, Coronenses.</p>

<p>30. Haliartus<a name="FNanchor_387" id="FNanchor_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">387</a> is no longer in existence, it was razed in the
war against Perseus. The territory is occupied by the Athenians,
to whom it was given by the Romans. It was situated
in a narrow spot between an overhanging mountain and the
lake Copa&iuml;s, near the Permessus, the Olme&iuml;us, and the marsh
that produces the flute-reed.</p>

<p>31. Plat&aelig;&aelig;, which the poet uses in the singular number,
lies at the foot of Cith&aelig;ron, between this mountain and Thebes,
on the road to Athens and Megara; it is on the borders of
Attica and B&#339;otia, for Eleuther&aelig; is near, which some say belongs
to Attica, others to B&#339;otia. We have said that the
Asopus flows beside Plat&aelig;&aelig;. There the army of the Greeks
entirely destroyed Mardonius and three hundred thousand
Persians. They dedicated there a temple to Jupiter Eleutherius,
and instituted gymnastic games, called Eleutheria, in
which the victor was crowned. The tombs erected at the
public expense, in honour of those who died in the battle, are
to be seen there. In the Sicyonian district is a demus called
Plat&aelig;&aelig;, where the poet Mnasalces was born:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;the monument of Mnasalces of Plat&aelig;&aelig;.&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Glissas,<a name="FNanchor_388" id="FNanchor_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">388</a> Homer says, is a village on Mount Hypatus, which
is near Teumessus and Cadmeia, in the Theban territory.
* * * * * * * beneath is what is called the Aonian plain,
which extends from Mount Hypatus [to Cadmeia?].<a name="FNanchor_389" id="FNanchor_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">389</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>


<p>32. By these words of the poet,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;those who occupied under Thebes,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_390" id="FNanchor_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">390</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>some understand a small town, called Under-Thebes, others
Potni&aelig;, for Thebes was abandoned after the expedition of the
Epigoni, and took no part in the Trojan war. Others say
that they did take part in it, but that they lived at that time
under Cadmeia, in the plain country, after the incursion of the
Epigoni, being unable to rebuild the Cadmeia. As Thebes
was called Cadmeia, the poet says that the Thebans of that
time lived &#8220;under Thebes&#8221; instead of &#8220;under Cadmeia.&#8221;</p>

<p>33. The Amphictyonic council usually assembled at Onchestus,
in the territory of Haliartus, near the lake Copa&iuml;s,
and the Teneric plain. It is situated on a height, devoid of
trees, where is a temple of Neptune also without trees. For
the poets, for the sake of ornament, called all sacred places
groves, although they were without trees. Such is the language
of Pindar, when speaking of Apollo:</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;He traversed in his onward way the earth and sea; he stood upon the
heights of the lofty mountains; he shook the caves in their deep recesses,
and overthrew the foundations of the sacred groves&#8221; or temples.</p>

<p>As Alc&aelig;us is mistaken in the altering the name of the river
Cuarius, so he makes a great error in placing Onchestus at
the extremities of Helicon, whereas it is situated very far from
this mountain.</p>

<p>34. The Teneric plain has its name from Tenerus. According
to mythology, he was the son of Apollo and Melia,
and declared the answers of the oracle at the mountain Ptoum,<a name="FNanchor_391" id="FNanchor_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">391</a>
which, the same poet says, had three peaks:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;At one time he occupied the caves of the three-headed Ptoum;&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>and he calls Tenerus</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;the prophet, dwelling in the temple, and having the same name as the
soil on which it stands.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Ptoum is situated above the Teneric plain, and the lake
Copa&iuml;s, near Acr&aelig;phium.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]<br />[CAS. 413]</a></span></p>

<p>Both the oracle and the mountain belonged to the Thebans.</p>

<p>Acr&aelig;phium<a name="FNanchor_392" id="FNanchor_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">392</a> itself is situated upon a height. This, it is
said, is the place called Arn&#275; by the poet, having the same
name as the Thessalian Arn&#275;.</p>

<p>35. Some say that Arn&#275; and Mideia were swallowed up by
the lake. Zenodotus, however, when he writes the verse thus,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;they who occupied Ascra abounding with vines,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_393" id="FNanchor_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">393</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>does not seem to have read Hesiod&#8217;s description of his native
country, and what has been said by Eudoxus, who relates
things much more to the disparagement of Ascra. For how
could any one believe that such a place could have been described
by the poet as</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;abounding with vines?&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Neither are those persons in the right, who substitute in this
passage Tarn&#275; for Arn&#275;, for there is not a place of the name
of Tarne to be found in B&#339;otia, although there is in Lydia.
Homer mentions it,</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;Idomeneus then slew Ph&aelig;stus, the son of Borus, the artificer, who came
from the fruitful soil of Tarn&#275;.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_394" id="FNanchor_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">394</a></p>

<p>Besides Alalcomen&aelig; and Tilphossium, which are near the
lake, Ch&aelig;roneia, Lebadia, and Leuctra, are worthy of notice.</p>

<p>36. The poet mentions Alalcomen&aelig;,<a name="FNanchor_395" id="FNanchor_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">395</a> but not in the Catalogue;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;the Argive Juno and Minerva of Alalcomen&aelig;.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_396" id="FNanchor_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">396</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>It has an ancient temple of Minerva, which is held in great
veneration. It is said that this was the place of her birth, as
Argos was that of Juno, and that Homer gave to both these
goddesses designations derived from their native places. Perhaps
for this reason he has not mentioned, in the Catalogue,
the inhabitants; for having a sacred character, they were exempted
from military service. Indeed the city has never suffered
devastation by an enemy, although it is inconsiderable
in size, and its position is weak, for it is situated in a plain.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>All in reverence to the goddess abstained from every act of
violence; wherefore the Thebans, at the time of the expedition
of the Epigoni, abandoning their own city, are said to
have taken refuge here, and on the strong mountain above it,
the Tilphossium.<a name="FNanchor_397" id="FNanchor_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">397</a> Below Tilphossium is the fountain Tilphossa,
and the monument of Teiresias, who died there on
the retreat.</p>

<p>37. Ch&aelig;roneia<a name="FNanchor_398" id="FNanchor_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">398</a> is near Orchomenus,<a name="FNanchor_399" id="FNanchor_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">399</a> where Philip, the son
of Amyntas, after having overcome, in a great battle,<a name="FNanchor_400" id="FNanchor_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">400</a> the
Athenians, B&#339;otians, and Corinthians, became the master of
Greece. There are seen the sepulchres erected at the public
charge of the persons who fell in that battle.</p>

<p>38. At Lebadeia<a name="FNanchor_401" id="FNanchor_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">401</a> is the oracle of Jupiter Trophonius,
having a descent through an opening, which leads under-ground.
The person himself, who consults the oracle, descends
into it. It is situated between Helicon and Ch&aelig;roneia,
near Coroneia.</p>

<p>39. Leuctra<a name="FNanchor_402" id="FNanchor_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">402</a> is the place where Epaminondas overcame the
Laced&aelig;monians in a great battle, and first weakened their
power; for after that time they were never able to regain the
supremacy over the Greeks, which they before possessed,
and particularly after they were defeated in a second battle at
Mantinea. Even after these reverses they preserved their
independence until the establishment of the Roman dominion,
and were always respected by that people on account of the
excellency of their form of government. The field of battle
is shown on the road which leads from Plat&aelig;&aelig; to Thespi&aelig;.</p>

<p>40. The poet next mentions the Orchomenians in the Catalogue,
and distinguishes them from the B&#339;otian nation. He
gives to Orchomenus the epithet Minyeian from the nation of
the Miny&aelig;. They say that a colony of the Minyeians went
hence to Iolcus,<a name="FNanchor_403" id="FNanchor_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">403</a> and from this circumstance the Argonauts
were called Miny&aelig;. It appears that, anciently, it was a rich
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]<br />[CAS. 414]</a></span>
and very powerful city. Homer bears witness to its wealth,
for in his enumeration of places of great opulence, he says,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;Not all that is brought to Orchomenus, or to &AElig;gyptian Thebes.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_404" id="FNanchor_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">404</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Of its power there is this proof, that the Thebans always paid
tribute to the Orchomenians, and to Erginus their king, who it
is said was put to death by Hercules. Eteocles, one of the
kings that reigned at Orchomenus, first displayed both wealth
and power. He built a temple dedicated to the Graces, who
were thus honoured by him, either because he had been fortunate
in receiving or conferring favours, or perhaps for both
these reasons.</p>

<p>[For one who was inclined thus to honour these goddesses,
must have been naturally disposed to be a benefactor,
and he must have possessed the power. But for this purpose
wealth is required. For he who has not much cannot give
much, nor can he who does not receive much possess much;
but when giving and receiving unite, then there is a just exchange.
For a vessel which is simultaneously emptied and
filled is always full; but he who gives and does not receive
cannot succeed in either giving or receiving, for the giver
must desist from giving from failure of means. Givers also
will desist from giving to him who receives only, and confers
no benefits, so that he must fail in receiving. The same may
be said of power. For independently of the common saying,</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">&#8220;That money is the thing most highly valued,</div>
<div class="line">And has the greatest influence in human affairs,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_405" id="FNanchor_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">405</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>we may examine the subject more in detail. We say, for example,
that kings have the greatest power, (&#956;&#8049;&#955;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#945; &#948;&#8059;&#957;&#945;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953;,)
whence the name, dynasty. Their power is exerted by leading
the multitude whither they like, by persuasion or by force.
Their power of persuasion chiefly rests in doing acts of kindness;
for persuasion by words is not princely, but belongs to
the orator. By princely persuasion, I mean, when kings direct
and lead men whither they please by acts of kindness.
They persuade by acts of kindness, but compel by means of
arms. Both power and possessions may be purchased by
money. For he has the largest body of forces, who is able to
maintain the largest; and he who has the largest possessions,
can confer the greatest benefits.<a name="FNanchor_406" id="FNanchor_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">406</a>]</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>The spot which the present lake Copa&iuml;s occupies, was formerly,
it is said, dry ground, and was cultivated in various
ways by the Orchomenians, who lived near it; and this is alleged
as a proof of wealth.</p>

<p>41. Some persons use the word Aspledon<a name="FNanchor_407" id="FNanchor_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">407</a> without the first
syllable, Spledon. The name both of the city and of the territory
was changed to Eudeielos,<a name="FNanchor_408" id="FNanchor_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">408</a> which expressed perhaps
some peculiar advantage the inhabitants derived from their
western position, and especially the mild winters. The extreme
parts of the day are the coldest. Of these the evening
is colder than the morning, for as night approaches the cold is
more intense, and as night retires the cold abates. The
severity of the cold is mitigated by the heat of the sun, and
the part which during the coldest season has received most of
the sun&#8217;s heat, is mildest in winter.</p>

<p>It is distant from Orchomenus<a name="FNanchor_409" id="FNanchor_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">409</a> 20 stadia. The river
Melas is between them.</p>

<p>42. Panopeus, a Phocian city, and Hyampolis<a name="FNanchor_410" id="FNanchor_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">410</a> are situated
above Orchomenus. Opus, the metropolis of the Locri Epicnemidii,
borders upon these places. It is said, that Orchomenus
was formerly situated on a plain, but, as the waters
overflowed, the settlers removed to the mountain Acontium,
which extends 60 stadia in length, as far as Parapotamii in
Phocis. It is said, that those people, who are called Ach&aelig;i in
Pontus, are colonists from the Orchomenians, who, after the
capture of Troy, wandered thither under the conduct of Ialmenus.
There was also an Orchomenus near Carystus.</p>

<p>The writers on the Catalogue of Ships [in Homer], have
furnished us with these materials, and they have been followed,
wherever they introduced anything adapted to the
design of this work.</p>

<hr />

<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Next</span> to B&#339;otia and Orchomenus is Phocis, lying along
the side of B&#339;otia to the north, and, anciently, nearly from sea
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]<br />[CAS. 416]</a></span>
to sea. For at that time Daphnus belonged to Phocis, dividing
Locris into two parts, and situated midway between the Opuntian
Gulf and the sea-coast of the Epicnemidii. At present,
however, the district belongs to the Locri; but the town is in
ruins, so that Phocis no longer extends to the sea opposite Eub&#339;a;
but it is close to the Cris&aelig;an Gulf. For Crisa itself belongs
to Phocis, and is situated immediately upon the sea.
Cirrha, Anticyra,<a name="FNanchor_411" id="FNanchor_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">411</a> and the places above them, in the interior
near Parnassus in continuous succession, namely, Delphi,<a name="FNanchor_412" id="FNanchor_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">412</a>
Cirphis, and Daulis,<a name="FNanchor_413" id="FNanchor_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">413</a> belong to Phocis, so also Parnassus itself,
which is the boundary of the western side.</p>

<p>In the same manner as Phocis lies along the side of B&#339;otia,
so are both the divisions of Locris situated with respect to
Phocis, for Locris is composed of two parts, being divided by
Parnassus. The western part lies along the side of Parnassus,
occupies a portion of it, and extends to the Cris&aelig;an Gulf; the
eastern part terminates at the sea near Eub&#339;a. The inhabitants
of the former are called Locri Hesperii, or Locri Ozol&aelig;, and
have engraven on their public seal the star Hesperus. The rest
are again divided into two bodies: one, the Opuntii, who have
their name from the chief city, and border upon the Phoc&aelig;ans
and B&#339;otians; the other, the Epicnemidii, who have their
name from the mountain Cnemis;<a name="FNanchor_414" id="FNanchor_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">414</a> and adjoin the &#338;t&aelig;i,
and the Malienses. In the midst of the Hesperii, and the
other Locri, is Parnassus, lying lengthwise towards the northern
part, and extending from the neighbourhood of Delphi to
the junction of the &#338;t&aelig;an, and the &AElig;tolian mountains, and
to the Dorians, who are situated between them. For as both
divisions of Locris extend along the side of Phocis, so also the
region of &#338;ta with &AElig;tolia, and some of the places situated in
the Doric Tetrapolis, extend along the sides of the two Locri,
Parnassus and the Dorians. Immediately above these are
situated the Thessalians, the northern &AElig;tolians, the Acarnanians,
and some of the Epirotic and Macedonian nations, as I
observed before, the above-mentioned tracts of country may
be considered as a kind of parallel bands stretching from the
west to the east.</p>

<p>The whole of Parnassus is esteemed sacred, it contains
caves, and other places, which are regarded with honour and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
reverence. Of these the most celebrated and the most beautiful
is Corycium, a cave of the nymphs, having the same
name as that in Cilicia. Of the sides of Parnassus, the western
is occupied by the Locri Ozol&aelig;, and by some of the Dorians,
and by the &AElig;toli, situated near Corax, an &AElig;tolian
mountain. The eastern side is occupied by Phocians and by
the greater part of the Dorians, who hold the Tetrapolis, situated
as it were round the side of Parnassus, but spreading out
in the largest extent towards the east. The sides of the
above-mentioned tracts and each of the bands are parallel, one
side being northern, and the other southern. The western
sides, however, are not parallel to the eastern, for the sea-coast
from the Cris&aelig;an Gulf to Actium<a name="FNanchor_415" id="FNanchor_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">415</a> is not parallel to the coast
opposite Eub&#339;a, and extending to Thessalonica. It is on
these shores the above-mentioned nations terminate. For the
figure of these countries is to be understood from the notion of
lines drawn parallel to the base of a triangle, where the separate
parts lie parallel to one another, and have their sides in
latitude parallel, but not their sides in longitude. This is a
rough sketch of the country which remains to be examined.
We shall examine each separate part in order, beginning with
Phocis.</p>

<p>2. The two most celebrated cities of this country are Delphi
and Elateia. Delphi is renowned for the temple of the
Pythian Apollo, and the antiquity of its oracle; since Agamemnon
is said by the poet to have consulted it; for the minstrel
is introduced singing of the</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;fierce contest of Ulysses, and Achilles, the son of Peleus, how once they
contended together, and Agamemnon king of men was pleased, for so
Ph&#339;bus Apollo had foretold by the oracle in the illustrious Pytho.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_416" id="FNanchor_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">416</a></p>

<p>Delphi then was celebrated on this account. Elateia was
famous as being the largest of the cities in that quarter, and
for its very convenient position upon the straits; for he, who
is the master of this city, commands the entrances into Phocis
and B&#339;otia. First, there are the &#338;t&aelig;an mountains, next the
mountains of the Locri, and the Phocians; they are not every
where passable for invading armies, coming from Thessaly,
but having narrow passes distinct from each other, which the
adjacent cities guard. Those, who take the cities, are masters
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]<br />[CAS. 418]</a></span>
of the passes also. But since from its celebrity the temple at
Delphi possesses a pre-eminence, this, together with the position
of the places, (for they are the most westerly parts of
Phocis,) suggest a natural commencement of our description,
and we shall begin from thence.</p>

<p>3. We have remarked, that Parnassus itself is situated on
the western boundaries of Phocis. The western side of this
mountain is occupied by the Locri Ozol&aelig;; on the southern is
Delphi, a rocky spot, resembling in shape a theatre; on its
summit is the oracle, and also the city, which comprehends a
circle of 16 stadia. Above it lies Lycoreia; here the Delphians
were formerly settled above the temple. At present
they live close to it around the Castalian fountain. In front
of the city, on the southern part, is Cirphis, a precipitous hill,
leaving in the intermediate space a wooded ravine, through
which the river Pleistus flows. Below Cirphis near the sea
is Cirrha, an ancient city, from which there is an ascent to
Delphi of about 80 stadia. It is situated opposite to Sicyon.
Adjoining to Cirrha is the fertile Cris&aelig;an plain. Again,
next in order follows another city Crisa, from which the
Cris&aelig;an Gulf has its name; then Anticyra,<a name="FNanchor_417" id="FNanchor_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">417</a> of the same name
as the city, on the Maliac Gulf, and near &#338;ta. The best
hellebore is said to grow in the Maliac Anticyra,<a name="FNanchor_418" id="FNanchor_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">418</a> but here
it is prepared in a better manner; on this account many
persons resort hither for the purpose of experiencing its
purgative qualities, and of being cured of their maladies. In
the Phocian territory there is found a medicinal plant, resembling
Sesamum, (Sesamoides,) with which the &#338;t&aelig;an hellebore
is prepared.</p>

<p>4. Anticyra still remains, but Cirrha and Crisa<a name="FNanchor_419" id="FNanchor_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">419</a> are in
ruins; Cirrha was destroyed by the Cris&aelig;ans; and Crisa,
afterwards, by Eurylochus the Thessalian, in the Cris&aelig;an
war; for the Cris&aelig;i enriched themselves by duties levied on
merchandise brought from Sicily and Italy, and laid grievous
imposts on those who resorted to the temple, contrary to the
decrees of the Amphictyons. The same was the case with the
Amphissenses, who belong to the Locri Ozol&aelig;. This people
made an irruption into the country, and took possession of
Crisa, and restored it. The plain, which had been consecrated
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
by the Amphictyons, was diligently cultivated, but strangers
were more harshly treated than by the Cris&aelig;ans before them.
The Amphictyons punished them and restored the territory to
the god. The temple at Delphi is now much neglected, although
formerly it was held in the greatest veneration. Proofs of the
respect which was paid to it are, the treasuries constructed at
the expense of communities and princes, where was deposited
the wealth dedicated to sacred uses, the works of the most
eminent artists, the Pythian games, and a multitude of celebrated
oracles.</p>

<p>5. The place where the oracle is delivered, is said to be a
deep hollow cavern, the entrance to which is not very wide.
From it rises up an exhalation which inspires a divine frenzy:
over the mouth is placed a lofty tripod on which the Pythian
priestess ascends to receive the exhalation, after which she
gives the prophetic response in verse or prose. The prose is
adapted to measure by poets who are in the service of the
temple. Phemono&euml; is said to have been the first Pythian prophetess,
and both the prophetess and the city obtained their
appellation from the word Pythesthai, to inquire, (&#960;&#965;&#952;&#8051;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953;).
The first syllable was lengthened, as in the words &#7936;&#952;&#8049;&#957;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#962;, &#7936;&#954;&#8049;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#962;, &#948;&#953;&#8049;&#954;&#959;&#957;&#959;&#962;.</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_420" id="FNanchor_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">420</a>
[The establishment of cities, and the honour paid to common
temples, are due to the same feelings and causes. Men were
collected together into cities and nations, from a natural disposition
to society, and for the purpose of mutual assistance.
Hence common temples were resorted to, festivals celebrated,
and meetings held of the general body of the people. For
friendship commences from and is promoted by attending the
same feasts, uniting in the same worship, and dwelling under
the same roof. The advantages derived from these meetings
were naturally estimated from the number of persons who attended
them, as also from the number of places from whence
they came.]</p>

<p>6. Although the highest honour was paid to this temple on
account of the oracle, (for it was the most exempt of any from
deception,) yet its reputation was owing in part to its situation
in the centre of all Greece, both within and without the isthmus.
It was also supposed to be the centre of the habitable
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]<br />[CAS. 420]</a></span>
earth, and was called the Navel of the earth. A fable, referred
to by Pindar, was invented, according to which two
eagles, (or, as others say, two crows,) set free by Jupiter, one
from the east, the other from the west, alighted together at
Delphi. In the temple is seen a sort of navel wrapped in
bands, and surmounted by figures representing the birds of
the fable.</p>

<p>7. As the situation of Delphi is convenient, persons easily
assembled there, particularly those from the neighbourhood, of
whom the Amphictyonic body is composed. It is the business
of this body to deliberate on public affairs, and to it is more
particularly intrusted the guardianship of the temple for the
common good; for large sums of money were deposited there,
and votive offerings, which required great vigilance and
religious care. The early history of this body is unknown,
but among the names which are recorded, Acrisius appears to
have been the first who regulated its constitution, to have
determined what cities were to have votes in the council, and
to have assigned the number of votes and mode of voting. To
some cities he gave a single vote each, or a vote to two cities,
or to several cities conjointly. He also defined the class of
questions which might arise between the different cities,
which were to be submitted to the decision of the Amphictyonic
tribunal; and subsequently many other regulations were
made, but this body, like that of the Ach&aelig;ans, was finally
dissolved.</p>

<p>At first twelve cities are said to have assembled, each of
which sent a Pylagoras. The convention was held twice a
year, in spring and autumn. But latterly a greater number
of cities assembled. They called both the vernal and the
autumnal convention Pyl&aelig;an, because it was held at Pyl&aelig;,
which has the name also of Thermopyl&aelig;. The Pylagor&aelig;
sacrificed to Ceres.</p>

<p>In the beginning, the persons in the neighbourhood only assembled,
or consulted the oracle, but afterwards people repaired
thither from a distance for this purpose, sent gifts, and
constructed treasuries, as Cr&#339;sus, and his father Alyattes,
some of the Italians also, and the Siceli (Sicilians).</p>

<p>8. But the wealth, being an object of cupidity, was guarded
with difficulty, although dedicated to sacred uses. At present,
however, whatever it might have been, the temple at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
Delphi is exceedingly poor. Some of the offerings have
been taken away for the sake of the money, but the greater
part remain there. It is true that the temple was once very
opulent, as Homer testifies;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;Nor all the wealth, which the marble threshold of Ph&#339;bus Apollo, the
Archer, (Aphetor,)<a name="FNanchor_421" id="FNanchor_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">421</a> contains in the rocky Pytho.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_422" id="FNanchor_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">422</a></p>

<p>The treasuries indicate its riches, and the plunder committed
by the Phocians, which gave rise to the Phocic or Sacred
war, as it was called. It is however supposed that a spoliation
of the temple must have taken place at some more remote
period, when the wealth mentioned by Homer disappeared;
for no vestige of it whatever was preserved to later
times, when Onomarchus and Phayllus pillaged the temple, as
the property [then] removed was of a more recent date than
that referred to by the poet. For there were once deposited
in the treasuries, offerings from spoils, bearing inscriptions
with the names of the donors, as of Gyges, of Cr&#339;sus, of the
Sybarit&aelig;, of the Spinet&aelig; on the Adriatic, and of others also.
It would be unbecoming to suppose<a name="FNanchor_423" id="FNanchor_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">423</a> that modern and ancient
treasures were confounded together: other places pillaged by
these people confirm this view.</p>

<p>Some persons, however, understanding the word Aphetor
to signify treasure, and the threshold of the aphetor the repository
of the treasure under-ground, say, that this wealth was
buried beneath the temple, and that Onomarchus and his
companions attempted to dig it up by night; violent shocks
of an earthquake caused them to fly out of the temple, and
desist from their excavation; thus others were impressed
with a dread of making similar attempts.</p>

<p>9. Of the shrines, the winged shrine<a name="FNanchor_424" id="FNanchor_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">424</a> is to be placed among
fabulous stories. The second is said to have been the workmanship
of Trophonius and Agamedes, but the present
shrine<a name="FNanchor_425" id="FNanchor_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">425</a> was built by the Amphictyons. A tomb of Neoptolemus
is shown in the sacred enclosure. It was built according
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]<br />[CAS. 421]</a></span>
to the injunction of an oracle. Neoptolemus was killed by
Mach&aelig;reus, a Delphian, when, as the fable goes, he was seeking
redress from the god for the murder of his father, but,
probably, he was preparing to pillage the temple. Branchus,
who presided over the temple at Didyma, is said to have been
a descendant of Mach&aelig;reus.</p>

<p>10. There was anciently a contest held at Delphi, of players
on the cithara, who executed a p&aelig;an in honour of the god. It
was instituted by Delphians. But after the Cris&aelig;an war the
Amphictyons, in the time of Eurylochus, established contests
for horses, and gymnastic sports, in which the victor was
crowned. These were called Pythian games. The players<a name="FNanchor_426" id="FNanchor_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">426</a>
on the cithara were accompanied by players on the flute, and
by citharists,<a name="FNanchor_427" id="FNanchor_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">427</a> who performed without singing. They performed
a strain (Melos),<a name="FNanchor_428" id="FNanchor_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">428</a> called the Pythian mood (Nomos).<a name="FNanchor_429" id="FNanchor_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">429</a>
It consisted of five parts; the anacrusis, the ampeira, cataceleusmus,
iambics and dactyls, and pipes.<a name="FNanchor_430" id="FNanchor_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">430</a> Timosthenes, the commander
of the fleet of the Second Ptolemy, and who was the
author of a work in ten books on Harbours, composed a melos.
His object was to celebrate in this melos the contest of Apollo
with the serpent Python. The anacrusis was intended to express
the prelude; the ampeira, the first onset of the contest;
the cataceleusmus, the contest itself; the iambics and dactyls
denoted the triumphal strain on obtaining the victory, together
with musical measures, of which the dactyl is peculiarly appropriated
to praise, and the use of the iambic to insult and
reproach; the syringes or pipes described the death, the
players imitating the hissings of the expiring monster.<a name="FNanchor_431" id="FNanchor_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">431</a></p>

<p>11. Ephorus, whom we generally follow, on account of his
exactness in these matters, (as Polybius, a writer of repute,
testifies,) seems to proceed contrary to his proposed plan, and
to the promise which he made at the beginning of his work.
For after having censured those writers who are fond of intermixing
fable with history, and after having spoken in
praise of truth, he introduces, with reference to this oracle, a
grave declaration, that he considers truth preferable at all
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
times, but especially in treating subjects of this kind. For it
is absurd, he says, if, in other things, we constantly follow this
practice, but that when we come to speak of the oracle, which
of all others is the most exempt from deception, we should
introduce tales so incredible and false. Yet immediately
afterwards he says, that it is the received opinion that
Apollo, by the aid of Themis, established this oracle with
a view to benefit the human race. He then explains these
benefits, by saying, that men were invited to pursue a more
civilized mode of life, and were taught maxims of wisdom by
oracles; by injunctions to perform or to abstain, or by positive
refusal to attend to the prayers of petitioners. Some,
he says, suppose, that the god himself in a bodily form directs
these things; others, that he communicates an intimation
of his will to men [by words].</p>

<p>12. And lower down, when speaking of the Delphians and
their origin, he says, that certain persons, called Parnassii,
an indigenous tribe, anciently inhabited Parnassus, about
which time Apollo, traversing the country, reclaimed men
from their savage state, by inducing them to adopt a more
civilized mode of life and subsistence; that, setting out from
Athens on his way to Delphi, he took the same road along
which the Athenians at present conduct the procession of the
Pythias; that when he arrived at the Panopeis, he put to
death Tityus, who was master of the district, a violent and
lawless man; that the Parnassii having joined him informed
him of Python, another desperate man, surnamed the Dragon.
Whilst he was despatching this man with his arrows, they
shouted, Hie Paian;<a name="FNanchor_432" id="FNanchor_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">432</a> whence has been transmitted the custom
of singing the P&aelig;an before the onset of a battle; that after the
death of the Python the Delphians burnt even his tent, as they
still continue to burn a tent in memorial of these events. Now
what can be more fabulous than Apollo discharging his arrows,
chastising Tityi and Pythons, his journey from Athens to
Delphi, and his travels over the whole country? If he did
not consider these as fables, why did he call the fabulous
Themis a woman, and the fabulous dragon a man, unless he
intended to confound the provinces of history and fable.
His account of the &AElig;tolians is similar to this. After having
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]<br />[CAS. 423]</a></span>
asserted that their country was never ravaged at any period,
he says, that at one time it was inhabited by &AElig;tolians, who
had expelled the Barbarians; that at another time, &AElig;tolus,
together with the Epeii from Elis, inhabited it; [that &AElig;tolus
was overthrown by the Epeii,] and these again by Alcm&aelig;on
and Diomedes.</p>

<p>I now return to the Phocians.</p>

<p>13. Immediately on the sea-coast, next after Anticyra,<a name="FNanchor_433" id="FNanchor_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">433</a> and
behind<a name="FNanchor_434" id="FNanchor_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">434</a> it, is the small city Marathus; then a promontory,
Pharygium, which has a shelter for vessels; then the harbour
at the farthest end, called Mychus,<a name="FNanchor_435" id="FNanchor_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">435</a> from the accident of its
situation between Helicon<a name="FNanchor_436" id="FNanchor_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">436</a> and Ascra.</p>

<p>Nor is Ab&aelig;,<a name="FNanchor_437" id="FNanchor_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">437</a> the seat of an oracle, far from these places,
nor Ambrysus,<a name="FNanchor_438" id="FNanchor_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">438</a> nor Medeon, of the same name as a city in
B&#339;otia.</p>

<p>In the inland parts, next after Delphi, towards the east is
Daulis,<a name="FNanchor_439" id="FNanchor_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">439</a> a small town, where, it is said, Tereus, the Thracian,
was prince; and there they say is the scene of the fable of
Philomela and Procne; Thucydides lays it there; but other
writers refer it to Megara. The name of the place is derived
from the thickets there, for they call thickets Dauli. Homer
calls it Daulis, but subsequent writers Daulia, and the words</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>are understood in a double sense; some persons supposing it
to have its name from the tree of the country, but others from
a village situated below the Lycoreian territory.</p>

<p>14. Panopeus, the present Phanoteus, the country of Epeius,
is on the confines of the district of Lebadeia. Here the fable
places the abode of Tityus. But Homer says, that the Ph&aelig;acians
conducted Rhadamanthus to Eub&#339;a,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div></div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
they show also in the island a cave called Elarium, from Elara
the mother of Tityus, and an Heroum of Tityus, and some
kind of honours are spoken of, which are paid to him.</p>

<p>Near Lebadeia is Trachin, having the same name as that
in &#338;t&aelig;a; it is a small Phocian town. The inhabitants are
called Trachinii.</p>

<p>15. Anemoreia<a name="FNanchor_442" id="FNanchor_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">442</a> has its name from a physical accident, to
which it is liable. It is exposed to violent gusts of wind from
a place called Catopterius,<a name="FNanchor_443" id="FNanchor_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">443</a> a precipitous mountain, extending
from Parnassus. It was a boundary between Delphi and the
Phocians, when the Laced&aelig;monians made the Delphians
separate themselves from the common body of the Phocians,<a name="FNanchor_444" id="FNanchor_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">444</a>
and permitted them to form an independent state.</p>

<p>Some call the place Anemoleia; it was afterwards called by
others Hyampolis,<a name="FNanchor_445" id="FNanchor_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">445</a> (and also Hya,) whither we said the Hyantes
were banished from B&#339;otia. It is situated quite in the
interior, near Parapotamii, and is a different place from Hyampea
on Parnassus.</p>

<p>Elateia<a name="FNanchor_446" id="FNanchor_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">446</a> is the largest of the Phocian cities, but Homer was
not acquainted with it, for it is later than his times. It is
conveniently situated to repel incursions on the side of Thessaly.
Demosthenes<a name="FNanchor_447" id="FNanchor_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">447</a> points out the advantage of its position,
in speaking of the confusion which suddenly arose, when
a messenger arrived to inform the Prytaneis of the capture of
Elateia.</p>

<p>16. Parapotamii is a settlement on the Cephissus, in the
neighbourhood of Phanoteus, Ch&aelig;roneia, and Elateia. This
place, according to Theopompus, is distant from Ch&aelig;roneia
about 40 stadia, and is the boundary between the Ambryseis,
Panopeis, and Daulieis. It is situated at the entrance from
B&#339;otia to the Phocians, upon an eminence of moderate
height, between Parnassus and the mountain [Hadylium,
where there is an open space] of 5 stadia in extent, through
which runs the Cephissus, affording on each side a narrow
pass. This river has its source at Lil&aelig;a, a Phocian city, as
Homer testifies;</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>and empties itself into the lake Copais. But Hadylium extends
60 stadia, as far as Hyphanteium, on which Orchomenus
is situated. Hesiod also enlarges on the river and its stream,
how it takes through the whole of Phocis an oblique and
serpentine course;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;which, like a serpent, winds along Panopeus and the strong Glechon, and
through Orchomenus.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_449" id="FNanchor_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">449</a></p>

<p>The narrow pass near Parapotamii, or Parapotamia, (for
the name is written both ways,) was disputed in [the Phocian
war,] for this is the only entrance [into Phocis].<a name="FNanchor_450" id="FNanchor_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">450</a></p>

<p>There is a Cephissus in Phocis, another at Athens, and
another at Salamis. There is a fourth and a fifth at Sicyon
and at Scyrus; [a sixth at Argos, having its source in the
Lyrceium].<a name="FNanchor_451" id="FNanchor_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">451</a> At Apollonia,<a name="FNanchor_452" id="FNanchor_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">452</a> also, near Epidamnus,<a name="FNanchor_453" id="FNanchor_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">453</a> there is
near the Gymnasium a spring, which is called Cephissus.</p>

<p>17. Daphnus<a name="FNanchor_454" id="FNanchor_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">454</a> is at present in ruins. It was at one time a
city of Phocis, and lay close to the Eub&#339;an Sea; it divided
the Locri Epicnemidii into two bodies, namely, the Locri on
the side of B&#339;otia,<a name="FNanchor_455" id="FNanchor_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">455</a> and the Locri on the side of Phocis, which
then extended from sea to sea. A proof of this is the Schedieum,
[in Daphnus,] called the tomb of Schedius.<a name="FNanchor_456" id="FNanchor_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">456</a> [It has
been already said] that Daphnus [divides] Locris into two
parts, [in such a manner as to prevent] the Epicnemidii and
Opuntii from touching upon each other in any part. In after-times
Daphnus was included within the boundaries of the
[Opuntii].</p>

<p>On the subject of Phocis, this may suffice.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Locris</span>, which we are now to describe, follows next in
order.</p>

<p>It is divided into two parts, one of which is occupied by the
Locri opposite Eub&#339;a, and, as we have already said, formerly
consisted of two bodies, situated one on each side of
Daphnus. The Locri Opuntii had their surname from Opus,<a name="FNanchor_457" id="FNanchor_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">457</a>
the capital; the Epicnemidii from a mountain called Cnemis.<a name="FNanchor_458" id="FNanchor_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">458</a>
The rest are the Locri Hesperii, who are called also Locri
Ozol&aelig;. These are separated from the Locri Opuntii and
Epicnemidii by Parnassus, which lies between them, and by
the Tetrapolis of the Dorians. We shall first speak of the
Opuntii.</p>

<p>2. Immediately after Hal&aelig;, where the B&#339;otian coast opposite
Eub&#339;a terminates, is the Opuntian bay. Opus is the
capital, as the inscription intimates, which is engraved on the
first of the five pillars at Thermopyl&aelig;, near the Polyandrium:<a name="FNanchor_459" id="FNanchor_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">459</a></p>

<p class="small">&#8220;Opoeis, the capital of the Locri, hides in its bosom those who died in
defence of Greece against the Medes.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is distant from the sea about 15 stadia, and 60 from the
naval arsenal. The arsenal is Cynus,<a name="FNanchor_460" id="FNanchor_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">460</a> a promontory, which
forms the boundary of the Opuntian bay. The latter is 40
stadia in extent. Between Opus and Cynus is a fertile plain,
opposite to &AElig;depsus in Eub&#339;a, where are the warm baths<a name="FNanchor_461" id="FNanchor_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">461</a>
of Hercules, and is separated by a strait of 160 stadia.
Deucalion is said to have lived at Cynus. There also is
shown the tomb of Pyrrha; but that of Deucalion is at
Athens. Cynus is distant from Mount Cnemis about 50
stadia. The island Atalanta<a name="FNanchor_462" id="FNanchor_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">462</a> is opposite to Opus, having the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]<br />[CAS. 425]</a></span>
same name as the island in front of Attica. It is said, that
some Opuntii are to be found in the Eleian territory, whom
it is not worth while to notice, except that they pretend to
trace some affinity subsisting between themselves and the
Locri Opuntii. Homer<a name="FNanchor_463" id="FNanchor_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">463</a> says that Patroclus was from Opus,
and that having committed murder undesignedly, he fled to
Peleus, but that the father Men&#339;tius remained in his native
country; for it is to Opus that Achilles promised Men&#339;tius
that he would bring back Patroclus on his return from the
Trojan expedition.<a name="FNanchor_464" id="FNanchor_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">464</a> Not that Men&#339;tius was king of the
Opuntii, but Ajax the Locrian, who, according to report, was
born at Narycus. The name of the person killed by Patroclus
was [Ae]anes; a grove, called after him [Ae]aneium, and a
fountain, [Ae]anis, are shown.</p>

<p>3. Next after Cynus is Alop&#275;<a name="FNanchor_465" id="FNanchor_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">465</a> and Daphnus, which last,
we have said, is in ruins. At Alop&#275; is a harbour, distant
from Cynus about 90 stadia, and 120 from Elateia, in the
interior of the country. But these belong to the Maliac,
which is continuous with the Opuntian Gulf.</p>

<p>4. Next to Daphnus, at the distance of about 20 stadia by
sea, is Cnemides, a strong place, opposite to which in Eub&#339;a
is Cen&aelig;um, a promontory, looking towards the west and the
Maliac Gulf, and separated by a strait of nearly 20 stadia.</p>

<p>At Cnemides we are in the territory of the Locri Epicnemidii.
Here are the Lichades, as they are called, three islands,
having their name from Lichas; they lie in front of Cnemides.
Other islands also are met with in sailing along this coast,
which we purposely pass over.</p>

<p>At the distance of 20 stadia from Cnemides is a harbour,
above which at the same distance, in the interior, is situated
Thronium.<a name="FNanchor_466" id="FNanchor_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">466</a> Then the Boagrius, which flows beside Thronium,
empties itself into the sea. It has another name also,
that of Manes. It is a winter torrent; whence its bed may
be crossed at times dry-shod, and at another it is two plethra
in width.</p>

<p>Then after these is Scarpheia, at a distance of 10 stadia
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
from the sea, and of 30 from Thronium, but at a little [less
from its harbour.]<a name="FNanchor_467" id="FNanchor_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">467</a> Next are Nic&aelig;a and Thermopyl&aelig;.</p>

<p>5. It is not worth while to speak of any of the other cities.
Of those mentioned by Homer, Calliarus is no longer inhabited,
it is now a well-cultivated plain. Bessa, a sort of plain,
does not now exist. It has its name from an accidental
quality, for it abounds with woods. &#967;&#8061;&#961;&#945;&#957; &#7956;&#967;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#953; &#931;&#954;&#945;&#961;&#966;&#953;&#949;&#8150;&#962;, &amp;c.
It ought to be written with a double s, for it has its name from
Bessa, a wooded valley, like Nap&#275;,<a name="FNanchor_468" id="FNanchor_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">468</a> in the plain of Methymna,<a name="FNanchor_469" id="FNanchor_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">469</a>
which Hellanicus, through ignorance of the local circumstances,
improperly calls Lap&#275;; but the demus in Attica, from
which the burghers are called Bes&aelig;enses, is written with a
single s.</p>

<p>6. Tarph&#275; is situated upon a height, at the distance of 20
stadia from [Thronium]. It has a territory, productive and
well wooded; for this place also has its name from its being
thickly wooded. It is now called Pharyg&aelig;. A temple of Juno
Pharyg&aelig;a is there, called so from the Argive Juno at Pharyg&aelig;;
and the inhabitants assert that they are of Argive origin.</p>

<p>7. Homer does not mention, at least not in express words,
the Locri Hesperii, but only seems to distinguish them from
the people of whom we have spoken;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;Locri, who dwell beyond the sacred Eub&#339;a;&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_470" id="FNanchor_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">470</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>as if there were other Locri. They occupied the cities Amphissa<a name="FNanchor_471" id="FNanchor_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">471</a>
and Naupactus.<a name="FNanchor_472" id="FNanchor_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">472</a> The latter still subsists near Antirrhium.<a name="FNanchor_473" id="FNanchor_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">473</a>
It has its name from the ships that were built there,
either because the Heraclid&aelig; constructed their fleet at this
place, or because the Locri, as Ephorus states, had built vessels
there long before that time. At present it belongs to the
&AElig;tolians, by a decree of Philip.</p>

<p>8. There also is Chalcis, mentioned by the poet<a name="FNanchor_474" id="FNanchor_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">474</a> in the
&AElig;tolian Catalogue. It is below Calydon. There also is the
hill Taphiassus, on which is the monument of Nessus, and of
the other Centaurs. From the putrefaction of the bodies of
these people there flows, it is said, from beneath the foot of
that hill a stream of water, which exhales a f&#339;tid odour, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]<br />[CAS. 427]</a></span>
contains clots of blood. Hence also the nation had the name
of Ozol&aelig;.<a name="FNanchor_475" id="FNanchor_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">475</a></p>

<p>Opposite Antirrhium is Molycreia,<a name="FNanchor_476" id="FNanchor_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">476</a> a small &AElig;tolian city.</p>

<p>Amphissa is situated at the extremity of the Cris&aelig;an plain.
It was razed, as we have said before, by the Amphictyons.
&#338;anthia and Eupalium belong to the Locri. The whole voyage
along the coast of the Locri is a little more than 200 stadia.</p>

<p>9. There is an Alope<a name="FNanchor_477" id="FNanchor_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">477</a> both here among the Locri Ozol&aelig;, as
also among the Epicnemidii, and in the Phthiotis. These are
a colony of the Epicnemidii, and the Epizephyrii a colony of
the Ozol&aelig;.</p>

<p>10. &AElig;tolians are continuous with the Locri Hesperii, and
the &AElig;nianes, who occupy &#338;ta with the Epicnemidii, and between
them Dorians. These last are the people who inhabited
the Tetrapolis, which is called the capital of all the
Dorians. They possessed the cities Erineus, B&#339;um, Pindus,
Cytinium. Pindus is situated above Erineus. A river of the
same name flows beside it, and empties itself into the Cephissus,
not far from Lil&aelig;a. Some writers call Pindus, Acyphas.</p>

<p>&AElig;gimius, king of these Dorians, when an exile from his
kingdom, was restored, as they relate, by Hercules. He requited
this favour after the death of Hercules at &#338;ta by
adopting Hyllus, the eldest of the sons of Hercules, and both he
and his descendants succeeded him in the kingdom. It was
from this place that the Heracleid&aelig; set out on their return to
Peloponnesus.</p>

<p>11. These cities were for some time of importance, although
they were small, and their territory not fruitful. They were
afterwards neglected. After what they suffered in the Phocian
war and under the dominion of the Macedonians, &AElig;tolians,
and Athamanes, it is surprising that even a vestige of
them should have remained to the time of the Romans.</p>

<p>It was the same with the &AElig;nianes, who were exterminated
by &AElig;tolians and Athamanes. The &AElig;tolians were a very
powerful people, and carried on war together with the Acarnanians.
The Athamanes were the last of the Epeirot&aelig;, who
attained distinction when the rest were declining, and acquired
power by the assistance of their king Amynander. The
&AElig;nianes, however, kept possession of &#338;ta.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>12. This mountain extends from Thermopyl&aelig; and the east, to
the Ambracian Gulf and the west; it may be said to cut at right
angles the mountainous tract, extending from Parnassus as far
as Pindus, and to the Barbarians who live beyond. The portion
of this mountain verging towards Thermopyl&aelig;<a name="FNanchor_478" id="FNanchor_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">478</a> is called
&#338;ta; it is 200 stadia in length, rocky and elevated, but the
highest part is at Thermopyl&aelig;, for there it forms a peak, and
terminates with acute and abrupt rocks, continued to the sea.
It leaves a narrow passage for those who are going from
Thessaly to Locris.</p>

<p>13. This passage is called Pyl&aelig;, or gates, straits, and Thermopyl&aelig;,
because near the straits are hot springs, which are
held in honour as sacred to Hercules. The mountain above
is called Callidromus; but some writers call by the name of
Callidromus the remaining part of the range extending
through &AElig;tolia and Acarnania to the Ambracian Gulf.</p>

<p>At Thermopyl&aelig; within the straits are strongholds, as
Nic&aelig;a, on the sea of the Locri, Teichius and Heracleia above
it, formerly called Trachin, founded by the Laced&aelig;monians.
Heracleia is distant from the ancient Trachin about 6 stadia.
Next follows Rhoduntia, strong by its position.</p>

<p>14. These places are rendered difficult of access by a rocky
country, and by bodies of water, forming ravines through
which they pass. For besides the Spercheius,<a name="FNanchor_479" id="FNanchor_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">479</a> which flows
past Anticyra, there is the Dyras, which, it is said, endeavoured
to extinguish the funeral pile of Hercules, and another
river, the Melas, distant about 5 stadia from Trachin. Herodotus
says,<a name="FNanchor_480" id="FNanchor_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">480</a> that to the south of Trachin there is a deep
fissure, through which the Asopus, (which has the same name
as other rivers that we have mentioned,) empties itself into
the sea without the Pyl&aelig;, having received the river Ph&#339;nix
which flows from the south, and unites with it. The latter
river bears the name of the hero, whose tomb is shown near it.
From the Asopus (Ph&#339;nix?) to Thermopyl&aelig; are 15 stadia.</p>

<p>15. These places were of the greatest celebrity when they
formed the keys of the straits. There were frequent contests
for the ascendency between the inhabitants without and those
within the straits. Philip used to call Chalcis and Corinth
the fetters of Greece with reference to the opportunity which
they afforded for invasions from Macedonia; and persons in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]<br />[CAS. 429]</a></span>
later times called both these places and Demetrias &#8220;the
fetters,&#8221; for Demetrias commanding Pelion and Ossa, commanded
also the passes at Tempe. Afterwards, however,
when the whole country was subject to one power, the passes
were freely open to all.<a name="FNanchor_481" id="FNanchor_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">481</a></p>

<p>16. It was at these straits that Leonidas and his companions,
together with a small body of persons from the
neighbourhood, resisted the numerous forces of the Persians,
until the Barbarians, making a circuit of the mountains along
narrow paths, surrounded and cut them to pieces. Their place
of burial, the Polyandrium, is still to be seen there, and the
celebrated inscription sculptured on the Laced&aelig;monian pillar;
&#8220;Stranger, go tell Laced&aelig;mon that we lie here in obedience
to her laws.&#8221;</p>

<p>17. There is also a large harbour here and a temple of
Ceres, in which the Amphictyons at the time of every Pyl&aelig;an
assembly offered sacrifice. From the harbour to the Heracleian
Trachin are 40 stadia by land, but by sea to Cen&aelig;um<a name="FNanchor_482" id="FNanchor_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">482</a>
it is 70 stadia. The Spercheius empties itself immediately
without the Pyl&aelig;. To Pyl&aelig; from the Euripus are 530 stadia.
And here Locris terminates. The parts without the Pyl&aelig; towards
the east, and the Maliac Gulf, belong to the Thessalians;
those towards the west, to the &AElig;tolians and Acarnanians.
The Athamanes are extinct.</p>

<p>18. The Thessalians form the largest and most ancient
community. One part of them has been mentioned by Homer,
and the rest by many other writers. Homer constantly mentions
the &AElig;tolians under one name; he places cities, and not
nations dependent upon them, if we except the Curetes, whom
we must place in the division of &AElig;tolians.</p>

<p>We must begin our account with the Thessalians, omitting
very ancient and fabulous stories, and what is not generally
admitted, (as we have done in other instances,) but propose
to mention what appears suited to our purpose.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">The</span> sea-coast, extending from Thermopyl&aelig; to the
mouths of the Peneius,<a name="FNanchor_483" id="FNanchor_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">483</a> and the extremities of Pelion, looking
towards the east, and the northern extremities of Eub&#339;a, is
that of Thessaly. The parts opposite Eub&#339;a and Thermopyl&aelig;
are occupied by Malienses, and by Ach&aelig;an Phthiot&aelig;;
those towards Pelion by the Magnetes. This may be called
the eastern and maritime side of Thessaly. From either side
from Pelion, and the Peneius, towards the inland parts are
Macedonians, who extend as far as P&aelig;onia, (Pindus?) and the
Epeirotic nations. From Thermopyl&aelig;, the &#338;t&aelig;an and &AElig;tolian
mountains, which approach close to the Dorians, and
Parnassus, are parallel to the Macedonians. The side towards
the Macedonians may be called the northern side; the other,
the southern. There remains the western side, enclosed by
&AElig;tolians and Acarnanians, by Amphilochians and Athamanes,
who are Epirot&aelig;; by the territory of the Molotti, formerly
said to be that of the &AElig;thices, and, in short, by the country
about Pindus. Thessaly,<a name="FNanchor_484" id="FNanchor_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">484</a> in the interior, is a plain country
for the most part, and has no mountains, except Pelion and
Ossa. These mountains rise to a considerable height, but do
not encompass a large tract of country, but terminate in the
plains.</p>

<p>2. These are the middle parts of Thessaly, a district of very
fertile country, except that part of it which is overflowed by
rivers. The Peneius flows through the middle of the country,
and receiving many rivers, frequently overflows. Formerly,
according to report, the plain was a lake; it is enclosed on all
sides inland by mountains, and the sea-coast is more elevated
than the plains. When a chasm was formed, at the place now
called Tempe, by shocks of an earthquake, and Ossa was riven
from Olympus, the Peneius flowed out through it to the sea,
and drained this tract of country. Still there remained the
large lake Nessonis, and the lake B&#339;beis; which is of less
extent than the Nessonis, and nearer to the sea-coast.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]<br />[CAS. 430]</a></span></p>

<p>3. Such then is Thessaly, which is divided into four parts,
Phthiotis, Hesti&aelig;otis, Thessaliotis, and Pelasgiotis.</p>

<p>Phthiotis comprises the southern parts, extending along
&#338;ta from the Maliac and (or) Pyla&iuml;c Gulf<a name="FNanchor_485" id="FNanchor_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">485</a> as far as Dolopia
and Pindus, increasing in breadth to Pharsalia and the Thessalian
plains.</p>

<p>Hesti&aelig;otis comprises the western parts and those between
Pindus and Upper Macedonia; the rest is occupied by the
inhabitants of the plains below Hesti&aelig;otis, who are called
Pelasgiot&aelig;, and approach close to the Lower Macedonians; by
the [Thessalians] also, who possess the country next in
order, as far as the coast of Magnesia.</p>

<p>The names of many cities might here be enumerated,
which are celebrated on other accounts, but particularly as
being mentioned by Homer; few of them, however, but most
of all Larisa, preserve their ancient importance.</p>

<p>4. The poet having divided the whole of the country, which
we call Thessaly, into ten<a name="FNanchor_486" id="FNanchor_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">486</a> parts and dynasties, and having
taken in addition some portion of the &#338;t&aelig;an and Locrian territory,
and of that also which is now assigned to the Macedonians,
shows (what commonly happened to every country) the
changes which, entirely or in part, they undergo according to
the power possessed by their respective governors.</p>

<p>5. The poet first enumerates the Thessalians subject to
Achilles, who occupied the southern side, and adjoined &#338;ta,
and the Locri Epicnemidii;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;All who dwelt in Pelasgic Argos; they who occupied Alus, Alope, and
Trachin; they who possessed Phthia, and Hellas, abounding with beautiful
women, were called Myrmidones, Hellenes, and Ach&aelig;i.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_487" id="FNanchor_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">487</a></p>

<p>He joins together with these the people under the command of
Ph&#339;nix, and makes them compose one common expedition.
The poet nowhere mentions the Dolopian forces in the battles
near Ilium, neither does he introduce their leader Ph&#339;nix, as
undertaking, like Nestor, dangerous enterprises. But Ph&#339;nix
is mentioned by others, as by Pindar,</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">&#8220;Who led a brave band of Dolopian slingers,</div>
<div class="line">Who were to aid the javelins of the Danai, tamers of horses.&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The words of the poet are to be understood according to the
figure of the grammarians, by which something is suppressed,
for it would be ridiculous for the king to engage in the expedition,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
(&#8220;I live at the extremity of Phthia, chief of the Dolopians,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_488" id="FNanchor_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">488</a>)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>and his subjects not to accompany him. For [thus] he would
not appear to be a comrade of Achilles in the expedition, but
only as the commander of a small body of men, and a speaker,
and if so, a counsellor. The verses seem to imply this meaning,
for they are to this effect,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;To be an eloquent speaker, and to achieve great deeds.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_489" id="FNanchor_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">489</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>From this it appears that Homer considered the forces
under Achilles and Ph&#339;nix as constituting one body; but the
places mentioned as being under the authority of Achilles, are
subjects of controversy.</p>

<p>Some have understood Pelasgic Argos to be a Thessalian
city, formerly situated near Larisa, but now no longer in existence.
Others do not understand a city to be meant by this
name, but the Thessalian plain, and to have been so called by
Abas, who established a colony there from Argos.</p>

<p><a name="ix_v_6" id="ix_v_6"></a>6. With respect to Phthia, some suppose it to be the same
as Hellas and Achaia, and that these countries form the southern
portion in the division of Thessaly into two parts. But
others distinguish Phthia and Hellas. The poet seems to distinguish
them in these verses;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;they who occupied Phthia and Hellas,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_490" id="FNanchor_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">490</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>as if they were two countries. And, again,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;Then far away through wide Greece I fled and came to Phthia,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_491" id="FNanchor_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">491</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>and,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;There are many Ach&aelig;an women in Hellas and Phthia.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_492" id="FNanchor_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">492</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The poet then makes these places to be two, but whether
cities or countries he does not expressly say. Some of the
later writers, who affirm that it is a country, suppose it to
have extended from Pal&aelig;pharsalus to Theb&aelig; Phthiotides.
In this country also is Thetidium, near both the ancient and
the modern Pharsalus; and it is conjectured from Thetidium
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]<br />[CAS. 432]</a></span>
that the country, in which it is situated, was a part of
that under the command of Achilles. Others, who regard it
as a city, allege that the Pharsalii show at the distance of 60
stadia from their own city, a city in ruins, which they believe
to be Hellas, and two springs near it, Messe&iuml;s and Hypereia.
But the Melit&aelig;enses say, that at the distance of about 10
stadia from their city, was situated Hellas on the other side
of the Enipeus,<a name="FNanchor_493" id="FNanchor_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">493</a> when their own city had the name of Pyrrha,
and that the Hellenes migrated from Hellas, which was built
in a low situation, to theirs. They adduce in proof of this
the tomb of Hellen, son of Deucalion and Pyrrha, which is in
their market-place. For according to historians, Deucalion
was king of Phthiotis and of all Thessaly. The Enipeus flows
from Othrys<a name="FNanchor_494" id="FNanchor_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">494</a> beside Pharsalus,<a name="FNanchor_495" id="FNanchor_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">495</a> and empties itself into the
Apidanus,<a name="FNanchor_496" id="FNanchor_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">496</a> and the latter into the Peneius.</p>

<p>Thus much, then, respecting the Hellenes.</p>

<p>7. The people under the command of Achilles, Protesilaus,
and Philoctetes, are called Phthii. The poet furnishes evidence
of this. Having recited in the Catalogue of those
under the command of Achilles,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;the people of Phthia,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_497" id="FNanchor_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">497</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>he represents them at the battle at the ships, as remaining in
the ships with Achilles, and inactive; but those under the
command of Philoctetes, as fighting with Medon [as their
leader], and those under the command of Protesilaus, with
Podarces [as their chief]. Of these the poet speaks in
general terms;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;there were B&#339;oti and Iaones wearing long robes, Locri, Phthii, and
illustrious Epeii.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_498" id="FNanchor_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">498</a></p>

<p>But here he particularizes them;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;at the head of the Phthii fought Medon and Podarces, firm in battle.
These armed with breastplates fought together with B&#339;oti, at the head of
the magnanimous Phthii, keeping away the enemy from the ships.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_499" id="FNanchor_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">499</a></p>

<p>Perhaps the people with Eurypylus were called Phthii, as
they bordered upon the country of the latter. At present,
however, historians assign to Magnesia the country about
Ormenium, which was subject to Eurypylus, and the whole of
that subject to Philoctetes; but they regard the country under
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
the command of Protesilaus as belonging to Phthia, from
Dolopia and Pindus to the sea of Magnesia; but as far as the
city Antron, (now written in the plural number,) which was
subject to Protesilaus, beginning from Trachinia and &#338;ta, is
the width of the territory belonging to Peleus and Achilles.
But this is nearly the whole length of the Maliac Gulf.</p>

<p>8. They entertain doubts respecting Halus and Alope,
whether Homer means the places which are now comprised
in the Phthiotic government, or those among the Locri, since
the dominion of Achilles extended hither as well as to Trachin
and the &#338;t&aelig;an territory. For Halus and Halius, as
well as Alope, are on the coast of the Locri. But some substitute
Halius for Alope, and write the verse in this manner;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;they who inhabited Halus, and Halius, and Trachin.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_500" id="FNanchor_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">500</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But the Phthiotic Halus lies under the extremity of the mountain
Othrys, which lies to the north of Phthiotis, and borders
upon the mountain Typhrestus and the Dolopians, and
thence stretches along to the country near the Maliac Gulf.
Halus,<a name="FNanchor_501" id="FNanchor_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">501</a> either masculine or feminine, for it is used in both
genders, is distant from Itonus<a name="FNanchor_502" id="FNanchor_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">502</a> about 60 stadia. Athamas
founded Halus; it was destroyed, but subsequently [restored by
the Pharsalii]. It is situated above the Crocian plain, and the
river Amphrysus<a name="FNanchor_503" id="FNanchor_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">503</a> flows by its walls. Below the Crocian plain
lies Theb&aelig; Phthiotides; Halus likewise, which is in Achaia,
is called Phthiotis; this, as well as the foot of Mount Othrys,
approaches close to the Malienses. As Phylace too, which was
under the command of Protesilaus, so Halus also belongs to
Phthiotis, which adjoins to the Malienses. Halus is distant from
Thebes about 100 stadia, and lies in the middle between Pharsalus
and Theb&aelig; Phthiotides. Philip, however, took it from
the latter, and assigned it to the Pharsalii. Thus it happens,
as we have said before, that boundaries and the distribution of
nations and places are in a state of continual change. Thus
Sophocles also called Phthiotis, Trachinia, Artemidorus places
Halus on the coast beyond the Maliac Gulf, but as belonging
to Phthiotis. For proceeding thence in the direction of the
Peneius, he places Pteleum after Antron, then Halus at the
distance of 110 stadia from Pteleum.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]<br />[CAS. 433]</a></span></p>

<p>I have already spoken of Trachin, and described the nature
of the place. The poet mentions it by name.</p>

<p>9. As Homer frequently mentions the Spercheius as a river
of the country, having its source in the Typhrestus, a Dryopian
mountain, formerly called [Tymphrestus], and emptying
itself near Thermopyl&aelig;, between Trachin and Lamia,<a name="FNanchor_504" id="FNanchor_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">504</a> he
might imply that whatever parts of the Maliac Gulf were
either within or without the Pyl&aelig;, were subject to Achilles.</p>

<p>The Spercheius is distant about 30 stadia from Lamia,
which lies above a plain, extending to the Maliac Gulf. That
the Spercheius is a river of the country [subject to Achilles],
appears from the words of Achilles, who says, that he
had devoted his hair to the Spercheius; and from the circumstance,
that Menesthius, one of his commanders, was said
to be the son of Spercheius and the sister of Achilles.</p>

<p>It is probable that all the people under the command of
Achilles and Patroclus, and who had accompanied Peleus in
his banishment from &AElig;gina, had the name of Myrmidons,
but all the Phthiot&aelig; were called Ach&aelig;ans.</p>

<p>10. They reckon in the Phthiotic district, which was subject
to Achilles, beginning from the Malienses, a considerable
number of towns, and among them Theb&aelig; Phthiotides, Echinus,
Lamia, near which the war was carried on between the
Macedonians and Antipater, against the Athenians. In this
war Leosthenes, the Athenian general, was killed, [and Leonnatus,]
one of the companions of Alexander the king. Besides
the above-mentioned towns, we must add [Narthac]ium,
Erineus, Coroneia, of the same name as the town in B&#339;otia,
Melit&aelig;a, Thaumaci, Proerna, Pharsalus, Eretria, of the same
name as the Euboic town, Parachelo&iuml;t&aelig;, of the same name
as those in &AElig;tolia; for here also, near Lamia, is a river Achelous,
on the banks of which live the Parachelo&iuml;t&aelig;.</p>

<p>This district, lying to the north, extended to the north-western
territory of the Asclepiad&aelig;, and to the territory of
Eurypylus and Protesilaus, inclining to the east; on the south
it adjoined the &#338;t&aelig;an territory, which was divided into fourteen
demi, and contained Heracleia and Dryopis, which was
once a community of four cities, (a Tetrapolis,) like Doris,
and accounted the capital of the Dryopes in Peloponnesus.
To the &#338;t&aelig;an district belong also the Acyphas, Parasopias,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
&#338;neiad&aelig;, and Anticyra, of the same name as the town among
the Locri Hesperii. I do not mean that these divisions always
continued the same, for they underwent various changes.
The most remarkable, however, are worthy of notice.</p>

<p>11. The poet with sufficient clearness describes the situation
of the Dolopes, as at the extremity of Phthia, and says that
both they and the Phthiot&aelig; were under the command of the
same chief, Peleus;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;I lived,&#8221; he says, &#8220;at the farthest part of Phthia, king of the Dolopes.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_505" id="FNanchor_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">505</a></p>

<p>Peleus, however, had conferred on him the authority.</p>

<p>This region is close to Pindus, and the places about it, most
of which belong to the Thessalians. For in consequence of
the renown and ascendency of the Thessalians and Macedonians,
those Epeirot&aelig;, who bordered nearest upon them, became,
some voluntarily, others by force, incorporated among
the Macedonians and Thessalians. In this manner the Athamanes,
&AElig;thices, and Talares were joined to the Thessalians,
and the Orest&aelig;, Pelagones, and Elimiot&aelig; to the Macedonians.</p>

<p>12. Pindus is a large mountain, having on the north Macedonia,
on the west Perrh&aelig;bi, settlers from another country,
on the south Dolopes, [and on the east Hesti&aelig;otis] which
belongs to Thessaly. Close upon Pindus dwelt Talares,
a tribe of Molotti, detached from the Molotti about Mount
Tomarus, and &AElig;thices, among whom the poet says the Centaurs
took refuge when expelled by Peirithous.<a name="FNanchor_506" id="FNanchor_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">506</a> They
are at present, it is said, extinct. But this extinction is to
be understood in two senses; either the inhabitants have
been exterminated, and the country deserted, or the name of
the nation exists no longer, or the community does not preserve
its ancient form. Whenever the community, which
continues, is insignificant, we do not think it worth while to
record either its existence or its change of name. But when
it has any just pretensions to notice, it is necessary to remark
the change which it has undergone.</p>

<p>13. It remains for us to describe the tract of sea-coast subject
to Achilles: we begin from Thermopyl&aelig;, for we have
spoken of the coast of Locris, and of the interior.</p>

<p>Thermopyl&aelig; is separated from the Cen&aelig;um by a strait 70
stadia across. Coasting beyond the Pyl&aelig;, it is at a distance
from the Spercheius of about 10, (60?) and thence to Phalara
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]<br />[CAS. 435]</a></span>
of 20 stadia. Above Phalara, 50 stadia from the sea, lies the
city of the [Lamians]. Then coasting along the shore 100
stadia, we find above it, Echinus. At the distance of 20 stadia
from the following tract of coast, in the interior, is Larisa
Cremaste, which has the name also of Larisa Pelasgia.</p>

<p>14. Then follows a small island, Myonnesus; next Antron;
which was subject to Protesilaus. Thus much concerning
the territory subject to Achilles.</p>

<p>As the poet, in naming the chiefs, and cities under their
rule, has divided the country into numerous well-known parts,
and has given an accurate account of the whole circuit of
Thessaly, we shall follow him, as before, in completing the
description of this region.</p>

<p>Next to the people under the command of Achilles, he
enumerates those under the command of Protesilaus. They
were situated, next, along the sea-coast which was subject to
Achilles, as far as Antron. The boundary of the country
under the command of Protesilaus, is determined by its being
situated without the Maliac Gulf, yet still in Phthiotis, though
not within Phthiotis subject to Achilles.</p>

<p>Phylac&#275;<a name="FNanchor_507" id="FNanchor_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">507</a> is near Theb&aelig; Phthiotides, which was subject to
Protesilaus, as were also Halus, Larisa Cremaste, and Demetrium,
all of which lie to the east of Mount Othrys.</p>

<p>The Demetrium he speaks of<a name="FNanchor_508" id="FNanchor_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">508</a> as an enclosure sacred to Ceres,
and calls it Pyrasus. Pyrasus was a city with a good harbour,
having at the distance of 2 stadia from it a grove, and a temple
consecrated to Ceres. It is distant from Theb&aelig; 20 stadia.
The latter is situated above Pyrasus. Above Theb&aelig; in the
inland parts is the Crocian plain at the extremity of the mountain
Othrys. Through this plain flows the river Amphrysus.
Above it is the Itonus, where is the temple of the Itonian
Minerva, from which that in B&#339;otia has its name, also the
river Cuarius. [Of this river and] of Arn&#275; we have spoken
in our account of B&#339;otia.</p>

<p>These places are in Thessaliotis, one of the four divisions of
all Thessaly, in which were the possessions of Eurypylus.
Phyllus, where is a temple of the Phyll&aelig;an Apollo, Ichn&aelig;,
where the Ichn&aelig;an Themis is worshipped, Cierus, and [all
the places as far as] Athamania, are included in Thessaliotis.</p>

<p>At Antron, in the strait near Eub&#339;a, is a sunk rock, called
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
&#8220;the Ass of Antron.&#8221; Next are Pteleum and Halus; next
the temple of Ceres, and Pyrasus in ruins; above these, Theb&aelig;;
then Pyrrha, a promontory, and two small islands near, one of
which is called Pyrrha, the other Deucalion. Somewhere
here ends the territory of Phthiotis.</p>

<p>15. The poet next mentions the people under Eumelus, and
the continuous tract of coast which now belongs to Magnesia,
and the Pelasgiotis.</p>

<p>Pher&aelig; is the termination of the Pelasgic plains towards
Magnesia, which plains extend as far as Pelion, a distance of
160 stadia. Pagas&aelig; is the naval arsenal of Pher&aelig;, from which
it is distant 90 stadia, and 20 from Iolcus. Iolcus has been
razed from ancient times. It was from this place that Pelias
despatched Jason and the ship Argo. Pagas&aelig; had its name,<a name="FNanchor_509" id="FNanchor_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">509</a>
according to mythologists, from the building of the ship Argo
at this place. Others, with more probability, suppose that the
name of the place was derived from the springs, (&#960;&#951;&#947;&#945;&#8055;,) which
are very numerous and copious. Near it is Aphet&aelig;, (so
named) as the starting-place<a name="FNanchor_510" id="FNanchor_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">510</a> from which the Argonauts set
off. Iolcus is situated 7 stadia from Demetrias, overlooking
the sea. Demetrias was founded by Demetrius Poliorcetes,
who called it after his own name. It is situated between
Nelia and Pagas&aelig; on the sea. He collected there the inhabitants
of the neighbouring small cities, Nelia, Pagas&aelig;, Ormenium,
and besides these, Rhizus, Sepias, Olizon, B&#339;be, and
Iolcus, which are at present villages belonging to Demetrias.
For a long time it was a station for vessels, and a royal seat of
the Macedonian kings. It had the command of Tempe, and
of both the mountains Pelion and Ossa. At present its extent
of power is diminished, yet it still surpasses all the cities
in Magnesia.</p>

<p>The lake B&#339;beis<a name="FNanchor_511" id="FNanchor_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">511</a> is near Pher&aelig;,<a name="FNanchor_512" id="FNanchor_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">512</a> and approaches close to
the extremities of Pelion and Magnesia. B&#339;be is a small
place situated on the lake.</p>

<p>As civil dissensions and usurpations reduced the flourishing
condition of Iolcus, formerly so powerful, so they affected
Pher&aelig; in the same manner, which was raised to prosperity,
and was destroyed by tyrants.</p>

<p>Near Demetrias flows the Anaurus. The continuous line
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]<br />[CAS. 436]</a></span>
of coast is called also Iolcus. Here was held the Pylaic
(Peliac?) assembly and festival.</p>

<p>Artemidorus places the Gulf of Pagas&aelig; farther from Demetrias,
near the places subject to Philoctetes. In the gulf he says
is the island Cicynethus,<a name="FNanchor_513" id="FNanchor_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">513</a> and a small town of the same name.</p>

<p>16. The poet next enumerates the cities subject to Philoctetes.</p>

<p>Methone is not the Thracian Methone razed by Philip.
We have already noticed the change of name these places and
others in the Peloponnesus have undergone. Other places
enumerated as subject to Philoctetes, are Thaumacia, Olizon,
and Melib&#339;a, all along the shore next adjacent.</p>

<p>In front of the Magnetes lie clusters of islands; the most
celebrated are Sciathus,<a name="FNanchor_514" id="FNanchor_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">514</a> Peparethus,<a name="FNanchor_515" id="FNanchor_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">515</a> Icus,<a name="FNanchor_516" id="FNanchor_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">516</a> Halonnesus, and
Scyrus,<a name="FNanchor_517" id="FNanchor_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">517</a> which contain cities of the same name. Scyrus however
is the most famous of any for the friendship which subsisted
between Lycomedes and Achilles, and for the birth and
education of Neoptolemus, the son of Achilles. In after
times, when Philip became powerful, perceiving that the
Athenians were masters of the sea, and sovereigns both of
these and other islands, he made those islands which lay near
his own country more celebrated than any of the rest. For
as his object in waging war was the sovereignty of Greece,
he attacked those places first which were near him; and as
he attached to Macedonia many parts of Magnesia itself, of
Thrace, and of the rest of the surrounding country, so also he
seized upon the islands in front of Magnesia, and made the
possession of islands which were before entirely unknown, a
subject of warlike contention, and brought them into notice.</p>

<p>Scyrus however is particularly celebrated in ancient histories.
It is also highly reputed for the excellence of its
goats, and the quarries of variegated marble, such as the
Carystian, the Deucallian, (Docim&aelig;an?) the Synnadic, and
the Hierapolitic kinds. For there may be seen at Rome
columns, consisting of a single stone, and large slabs of
variegated marble, (from Scyrus,) with which the city is embellished
both at the public charge and at the expense of individuals,
which has caused works of white marble to be little
esteemed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>17. The poet having proceeded so far along the Magnesian
coast, returns to Upper Thessaly, for beginning from Dolopia
and Pindus he goes through the region extending along
Phthiotis to Lower Thessaly.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;They who occupy Tricca and rocky Ithome.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_518" id="FNanchor_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">518</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>These places belong to Histi&aelig;otis, which was formerly called
Doris. When it was in the possession of the Perrh&aelig;bi, who destroyed
Histi&aelig;otis in Eub&#339;a, and had removed the inhabitants
by force to the continent, they gave the country the name of
Histi&aelig;otis, on account of the great numbers of Histi&aelig;ans among
the settlers. This country and Dolopia are called Upper Thessaly,
which is in a straight line with Upper Macedonia, as
Lower Thessaly is in a straight line with Lower Macedonia.</p>

<p>Tricca,<a name="FNanchor_519" id="FNanchor_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">519</a> where there is a very ancient and famous temple of
&AElig;sculapius, borders upon the Dolopes, and the parts about
Pindus.</p>

<p>Ithome, which has the same name as the Messenian Ithome,
ought not, they say, to be pronounced in this manner, but
should be pronounced without the first syllable, Thome, for
this was its former name. At present, it is changed to
[Thum&aelig;um]. It is a spot strong by nature, and in reality
rocky. It lies between four strong-holds, which form a square,
Tricca, Metropolis, Pelinn&aelig;um, and Gomphi.<a name="FNanchor_520" id="FNanchor_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">520</a> Ithome belongs
to the district of the Metropolit&aelig;. Metropolis was
formed at first out of three small obscure cities, and afterwards
more were included, and among these Ithome. Callimachus
says in his Iambics,</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;among the Venuses, (for the goddess bears several titles,) Venus Castnietis
surpasses all others in wisdom,&#8221;</p>

<p>for she alone accepts the sacrifice of swine. Certainly Callimachus,
if any person could be said to possess information,
was well informed, and it was his object, as he himself says,
all his life to relate these fables. Later writers, however,
have proved that there was not one Venus only, but several,
who accepted that sacrifice, from among whom the goddess
worshipped at Metropolis came, and that this [foreign] rite
was delivered down by one of the cities which contributed to
form that settlement.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]<br />[CAS. 438]</a></span></p>

<p>Pharcadon also is situated in the Hesti&aelig;otis. The Peneius
and the Curalius flow through it. The Curalius, after flowing
beside the temple of the Itonian Minerva, empties itself
into the Peneius.</p>

<p>The Peneius itself rises in Mount Pindus, as I have before
said. It leaves Tricca, Pelinn&aelig;um, and Pharcadon on the
left hand, and takes its course beside Atrax and Larisa.
After having received the rivers of the Thessaliotis it flows
onwards through Tempe, and it empties itself into the sea.</p>

<p>Historians speak of &#338;chalia, the city of Eurytus, as existing
in these parts, in Eub&#339;a also, and in Arcadia; but some
give it one name, others another, as I have said in the description
of Peloponnesus.</p>

<p>They inquire particularly, which of these was the city
taken by Hercules, and which was the city intended by the
author of the poem, &#8220;The Capture of &#338;chalia&#8221;?</p>

<p>The places, however, were subject to the Asclepiad&aelig;.</p>

<p>18. The poet next mentions the country which was under
the dominion of Eurypylus;</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">&#8220;They who possessed Ormenium and the spring Hypereia,</div>
<div class="line">And they who occupied Asterium and the white peaks of Titanus.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_521" id="FNanchor_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">521</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Ormenium is now called Orminium. It is a village situated
below Pelion, near the Pagasitic Gulf, but was one of
the cities which contributed to form the settlement of Demetrias,
as I have before said.</p>

<p>The lake B&#339;beis must be near, because both B&#339;be and
Ormenium belonged to the cities lying around Demetrias.</p>

<p>Ormenium is distant by land 27 stadia from Demetrias.
The site of Iolcus, which is on the road, is distant 7 stadia
from Demetrias, and the remaining 20 from Ormenium.</p>

<p>Demetrius of Scepsis says, that Ph&#339;nix came from Ormenium,
and that he fled thence from his father Amyntor,
the son of Ormenus, to Phthia, to king Peleus. For this place
was founded by Ormenus, the son of Cercaphus, the son of
&AElig;olus. The sons of Ormenus were Amyntor and Eu&aelig;mon;
the son of the former was Ph&#339;nix, and of the latter, Eurypylus.
The succession to his possessions was preserved secure
for Eurypylus, after the departure of Ph&#339;nix from his home,
and we ought to write the verse of the poet in this manner:</p>

<p>But Crates makes Ph&#339;nix a Phoc&aelig;an, conjecturing this
from the helmet of Meges, which Ulysses wore on the night
expedition; of which helmet the poet says,</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;Autolycus brought it away from Eleon, out of the house of Amyntor,
the son of Ormenus, having broken through the thick walls.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_523" id="FNanchor_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">523</a></p>

<p>Now Eleon was a small city on Parnassus, and by Amyntor,
the son of Ormenus, he could not mean any other person
than the father of Ph&#339;nix, and that Autolycus, who lived on
Parnassus, was in the habit of digging through the houses of
his neighbours, which is the common practice of every house-breaker,
and not of persons living at a distance. But Demetrius
the Scepsian says, that there is no such place on Parnassus
as Eleon, but Neon, which was built after the Trojan
war, and that digging through houses was not confined to
robbers of the neighbourhood. Other things might be advanced,
but I am unwilling to insist long on this subject.

<p>This country was formerly inhabited by Perrh&aelig;bi, who

its mouth and the city Gyrton, belonging to the district Perrh&aelig;bis.

having reduced the Perrh&aelig;bi,<a name="FNanchor_529" id="FNanchor_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor">529</a> got possession of these
places. Peirithous took possession also of Pelion, having expelled

it. These</p>

<p>but he delivered up the plains to the Lapith&aelig;. The Perrh&aelig;bi
kept possession of some of these parts, those, namely, towards
Olympus, and in some places they lived intermixed altogether
with the Lapith&aelig;.</p>

<p>Argissa, the present Argura, is situated upon the banks of
the Peneius. Atrax lies above it at the distance of 40 stadia,
close to the river. The intermediate country along the side
of the river was occupied by Perrh&aelig;bi.</p>

<p>Some call Orthe the citadel of the Phalann&aelig;i. Phalanna
is a Perrh&aelig;bic city on the Peneius, near Tempe.</p>

<p>The Perrh&aelig;bi, oppressed by the Lapith&aelig;, retreated in great
numbers to the mountainous country about Pindus, and to the
Athamanes and Dolopes; but the Laris&aelig;i became masters of
the country and of the Perrh&aelig;bi who remained there. The
Laris&aelig;i lived near the Peneius, but in the neighbourhood of
the Perrh&aelig;bi. They occupied the most fertile portion of the
plains, except some of the very deep valleys near the lake
Nessonis, into which the river, when it overflowed, usually
carried away a portion of the arable ground belonging to the
Laris&aelig;i, who afterwards remedied this by making embankments.</p>

<p>These people were in possession of Perrh&aelig;bia, and levied
imposts until Philip became master of the country.</p>

<p>Larisa is a place situated on Ossa, and there is Larisa
Cremaste, by some called Pelasgia. In Crete also is a city
Larisa, the inhabitants of which were embodied with those of
Hierapytna; and from this place the plain below is called the
Larisian plain. In Peloponnesus the citadel of the Argives is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
called Larisa, and there is a river Larisus, which separates
Eleia from Dyme. Theopompus mentions a city Larisa, situated
on the immediate confines of this country. In Asia is
Larisa Phriconis near Cume, and another Larisa near Hamaxitus,
in the Troad. There is also an Ephesian Larisa, and a
Larisa in Syria. At 50 stadia from Mitylene are the Laris&aelig;an
rocks, on the road to Methymne. There is a Larisa in
Attica; and a village of this name at the distance of 30 stadia
from Tralleis, situated above the city, on the road to the plain
of the Cayster, passing by Mesogis towards the temple of
Mater Isodroma. This Larisa has a similar position, and
possesses similar advantages to those of Larisa Cremaste; for
it has abundance of water and vineyards. Perhaps Jupiter
had the appellation of Laris&aelig;us from this place. There is
also on the left side of the Pontus (Euxine) a village called
Larisa, near the extremities of Mount H&aelig;mus, between Naulochus
[and Odessus].<a name="FNanchor_531" id="FNanchor_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">531</a></p>

<p>Oloosson, called the White, from its chalky soil, Elone, and
Gonnus are Perrh&aelig;bic cities. The name of Elone was changed
to that of Leimone. It is now in ruins. Both lie at the foot
of Olympus, not very far from the river Eurotas, which the
poet calls Titaresius.</p>

<p>20. The poet speaks both of this river and of the Perrh&aelig;bi
in the subsequent verses, when he says,</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;Guneus brought from Cyphus two and twenty vessels. His followers
were Enienes and Per&aelig;bi, firm in battle. They dwelt near the wintry
Dodona, and tilled the fields about the lovely Titaresius.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_532" id="FNanchor_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor">532</a></p>

<p>He mentions therefore these places as belonging to the Perrh&aelig;bi,
which comprised a part of the Hesti&aelig;otis.<a name="FNanchor_533" id="FNanchor_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor">533</a> They were
in part Perrh&aelig;bic towns, which were subject to Polyp&#339;tes.
He assigned them however to the Lapith&aelig;, because these
people and the Perrh&aelig;bi lived intermixed together, and the
Lapith&aelig; occupied the plains. The country, which belonged
to the Perrh&aelig;bi, was, for the most part, subject to the Lapith&aelig;,
but the Perrh&aelig;bi possessed the more mountainous
tracts towards Olympus and Tempe, such as Cyphus, Dodon&#275;,
and the country about the river Titaresius. This river rises
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]<br />[CAS. 441]</a></span>
in the mountain Titarius, which is part of Olympus. It flows
into the plain near Tempe belonging to Perrh&aelig;bia, and somewhere
there enters the Peneius.</p>

<p>The water of the Peneius is clear, that of the Titaresius
is unctuous; a property arising from some matter, which
prevents the streams mingling with each other,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;but runs over the surface like oil.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_534" id="FNanchor_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor">534</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Because the Perrh&aelig;bi and Lapith&aelig; lived intermingled together,
Simonides calls all those people Pelasgiot&aelig;, who occupy
the eastern parts about Gyrton and the mouths of the
Peneius, Ossa, Pelion, and the country about Demetrias, and
the places in the plain, Larisa, Crannon, Scotussa, Mopsium,
Atrax, and the parts near the lakes Nessonis and B&#339;beis.
The poet mentions a few only of these places, either because
they were not inhabited at all, or badly inhabited on account
of the inundations which had happened at various times.
For the poet does not mention even the lake Nessonis, but the
B&#339;beis only, which is much smaller, for its water remained
constant, and this alone remains, while the former probably
was at one time filled irregularly to excess, and at another
contained no water.</p>

<p>We have mentioned Scotussa in our accounts of Dodona,
and of the oracle, in Thessaly, when we observed that it was
near Scotussa. Near Scotussa is a tract called Cynoscephal&aelig;.
It was here that the Romans with their allies the &AElig;tolians, and
their general Titus Quintius, defeated in a great battle Philip,
son of Demetrius, king of Macedon.</p>

<p>21. Something of the same kind has happened in the territory
of Magnetis. For Homer having enumerated many
places of this country, calls none of them Magnetes, but those
only whom he indicates in terms obscure, and not easily understood;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;They who dwelt about Peneius and Pelion with waving woods.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_535" id="FNanchor_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535" class="fnanchor">535</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Now about the Peneius and Pelion dwell those (already
mentioned by Homer) who occupied Gyrton, and Ormenium,
and many other nations. At a still greater distance from
Pelion, according to later writers, were Magnetes, beginning
from the people, that were subject to Eumelus. These
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
writers, on account of the continual removals from one settlement
to another, alterations in the forms of government, and
intermixture of races, seem to confound both names and nations,
which sometimes perplexes persons in these times, as is
first to be observed in the instances of Crannon and Gyrton.</p>

<p>Formerly they called the Gyrtonians Phlegy&aelig;, from
Phlegyas, the brother of Ixion; and the Crannonii, Ephyri, so
that there is a doubt, when the poet says,</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;These two from Thrace appeared with breastplates armed against
Ephyri, or haughty Phlegy&aelig;,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_536" id="FNanchor_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">536</a></p>

<p>what people he meant.</p>

<p>22. The same is the case with the Perrh&aelig;bi and &AElig;nianes,
for Homer joins them together, as if they dwelt near each
other; and it is said by later writers, that, for a long period,
the settlement of the &AElig;nianes was in the Dotian plain. Now
this plain is near Perrh&aelig;bia, which we have just mentioned,
Ossa, and the lake B&#339;beis: it is situated about the middle of
Thessaly, but enclosed by itself within hills. Hesiod speaks of
it in this manner;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;Or, as a pure virgin, who dwells on the sacred heights of the Twin hills,
comes to the Dotian plain, in front of Amyrus, abounding with vines, to
bathe her feet in the lake B&#339;bias.&#8221;</p>

<p>The greater part of the &AElig;nianes were expelled by the Lapith&aelig;,
and took refuge in &#338;ta, where they established their power,
having deprived the Dorians and the Malienses of some portions
of country, extending as far as Heracleia and Echinus.
Some of them however remained about Cyphus, a Perrh&aelig;bic
mountain, where is a settlement of the same name. As to the
Perrh&aelig;bi, some of them collected about the western parts of
Olympus and settled there, on the borders of the Macedonians.
But a large body took shelter among the mountains near
Athamania, and Pindus. But at present few, if any, traces
of them are to be found.</p>

<p>The Magnetes, who are mentioned last in the Thessalian
catalogue of the poet, must be understood to be those situated
within Tempe, extending from the Peneius and Ossa to Pelion,
and bordering upon the Pieriot&aelig; in Macedonia, who occupy
the country on the other side of the Peneius as far as
the sea.</p>

<p>Homolium, or Homol&#275;, (for both words are in use,) must
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]<br />[CAS. 443]</a></span>
be assigned to the Magnetes. I have said in the description
of Macedonia, that Homolium is near Ossa at the beginning
of the course which the Peneius takes through Tempe.</p>

<p>If we are to extend their possessions as far as the sea-coast,
which is very near Homolium, there is reason for assigning to
them Rhizus, and Erymn&aelig;, which lies on the sea-coast in the
tract subject to Philoctetes and Eumelus. Let this however
remain unsettled. For the order in which the places as far as
the Peneius follow one another, is not clearly expressed, and
as the places are not of any note, we need not consider that
uncertainty as very important. The coast of Sepias, however,
is mentioned by tragic writers, and was chaunted in songs on
account of the destruction of the Persian fleet. It consists of
a chain of rocks.</p>

<p>Between Sepias and Casthan&aelig;a, a village situated below
Pelion, is the sea-shore, where the fleet of Xerxes was lying,
when an east wind began to blow violently; some of the vessels
were forced on shore, and immediately went to pieces,
others were driven on Hipnus, a rocky spot near Pelion,
others were lost at Melib&#339;a, others at Casthan&aelig;a.</p>

<p>The whole of the coasting voyage along Pelion, to the extent
of about 80 stadia, is among rocks. That along Ossa is
of the same kind and to the same extent.</p>

<p>Between them is a bay of more than 200 stadia in extent,
upon which is situated Melib&#339;a.</p>

<p>The whole voyage from Demetrias, including the winding
of the bays, to the Peneius is more than 1000 stadia, from the
Spercheius 800 stadia more, and from the Euripus 2350
stadia.</p>

<p>Hieronymus assigns a circuit of 3000 stadia to the plain
country in Thessaly and Magnesia, and says, that it was inhabited
by Pelasgi, but that these people were driven into
Italy by Lapith&aelig;, and that the present Pelasgic plain is that
in which are situated Larisa, Gyrton, Pher&aelig;, Mopsium, B&#339;beis,
Ossa, Homole, Pelion, and Magnetis. Mopsium has not
its name from Mopsus, the son of Manto the daughter of
Teiresias, but from Mopsus, one of the Lapith&aelig;, who sailed
with the Argonauts. Mopsopus, from whom Attica is called
Mopsopia, is a different person.</p>

<p>23. This then is the account of the several parts of Thessaly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p>In general we say, that it was formerly called Pyrrh&aelig;a,
from Pyrrha, the wife of Deucalion; H&aelig;monia, from H&aelig;mon;
and Thettalia, from Thettalus, the son of H&aelig;mon. But some
writers, after dividing it into two portions, say, that Deucalion
obtained by lot the southern part, and called it Pandora, from
his mother; that the other fell to the share of H&aelig;mon, from
whom it was called H&aelig;monia; that the name of one part was
changed to Hellas, from Hellen, the son of Deucalion, and of
the other to Thettalia, from Thettalus, the son of H&aelig;mon.
But, according to some writers, it was the descendants of Antiphus
and Pheidippus, sons of Thettalus, descended from
Hercules, who invaded the country from Ephyra in Thesprotia,
and called it after the name of Thettalus their progenitor.
It has been already said that once it had the name
of Nessonis, as well as the lake, from Nesson, the son of
Thettalus.</p>

<h2><big>BOOK X.<br /><br />

GREECE.</big><br /><br /></h2>

<p class="center f85">SUMMARY.</p>

<p class="indent">The Tenth Book contains &AElig;tolia and the neighbouring islands; also the
whole of Crete, on which the author dwells some time in narrating the
institutions of the islanders and of the Curetes. He describes at length
the origin of the Id&aelig;an Dactyli in Crete, their customs and religious
rites. Strabo mentions the connexion of his own family with Crete. The
Book contains an account of the numerous islands about Crete, including
the Sporades and some of the Cyclades.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Since</span> Eub&#339;a<a name="FNanchor_537" id="FNanchor_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">537</a> stretches along the whole of this coast
from Sunium to Thessaly, except the extremity on each side,<a name="FNanchor_538" id="FNanchor_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">538</a>
it may be convenient to connect the description of this island
with that of Thessaly. We shall then pass on to &AElig;tolia and
Acarnania, parts of Europe of which it remains to give an
account.</p>

<p>2. The island is oblong, and extends nearly 1200 stadia
from Cen&aelig;um<a name="FNanchor_539" id="FNanchor_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">539</a> to Ger&aelig;stus.<a name="FNanchor_540" id="FNanchor_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">540</a> Its greatest breadth is about
150 stadia, but it is irregular.<a name="FNanchor_541" id="FNanchor_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor">541</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<p>Cen&aelig;um is opposite to Thermopyl&aelig;, and in a small degree
to the parts beyond Thermopyl&aelig;: Ger&aelig;stus<a name="FNanchor_542" id="FNanchor_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor">542</a> and Petalia<a name="FNanchor_543" id="FNanchor_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor">543</a> are
opposite to Sunium.</p>

<p>Eub&#339;a then fronts<a name="FNanchor_544" id="FNanchor_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor">544</a> Attica, B&#339;otia, Locris, and the Malienses.
From its narrowness, and its length, which we have
mentioned, it was called by the ancients Macris.<a name="FNanchor_545" id="FNanchor_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">545</a></p>

<p>It approaches nearest to the continent at Chalcis. It projects
with a convex bend towards the places in B&#339;otia near
Aulis, and forms the Euripus,<a name="FNanchor_546" id="FNanchor_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor">546</a> of which we have before
spoken at length. We have also mentioned nearly all the
places on either side of the Euripus, opposite to each other
across the strait, both on the continent and on the island. If
anything is omitted we shall now give a further explanation.</p>

<p>And first, the parts lying between Aulis (Chalcis?) and
the places about Ger&aelig;stus are called the Hollows of Eub&#339;a,
for the sea-coast swells into bays, and, as it approaches Chalcis,
juts out again towards the continent.</p>

<p>3. The island had the name not of Macris only, but of
Abantis also. The poet in speaking of Eub&#339;a never calls the
inhabitants from the name of the island, Eub&#339;ans, but always
Abantes;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div></div></div>

<p>Aristotle says that Thracians, taking their departure from
Aba, the Phocian city, settled with the other inhabitants in
the island, and gave the name of Abantes to those who already
occupied it; other writers say that they had their name
from a hero,<a name="FNanchor_548" id="FNanchor_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor">548</a> as that of Eub&#339;a was derived from a heroine.<a name="FNanchor_549" id="FNanchor_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">549</a>
But perhaps as a certain cave on the sea-coast fronting the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]<br />[CAS. 445]</a></span>
&AElig;gean Sea is called Boos-Aule, (or the Cow&#8217;s Stall,) where
Io is said to have brought forth Epaphus, so the island may
have had the name Eub&#339;a<a name="FNanchor_550" id="FNanchor_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">550</a> on this account.</p>

<p>It was also called Och&eacute;, which is the name of one of the
largest mountains<a name="FNanchor_551" id="FNanchor_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor">551</a> there.</p>

<p>It had the name of Ellopia, from Ellops, the son of Ion;
according to others, he was the brother of &AElig;clus, and Cothus,
who is said to have founded Ellopia,<a name="FNanchor_552" id="FNanchor_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor">552</a> a small place
situated in the district called Oria of the Histi&aelig;otis, near the
mountain Telethrius.<a name="FNanchor_553" id="FNanchor_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553" class="fnanchor">553</a> He also possessed Histi&aelig;a, Perias,
Cerinthus, &AElig;depsus,<a name="FNanchor_554" id="FNanchor_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554" class="fnanchor">554</a> and Orobi&aelig;, where was an oracle very
free from deception. There also was an oracle of Apollo
Selinuntius.</p>

<p>The Ellopians, after the battle of Leuctra, were compelled
by the tyrant Philistides to remove to the city Histi&aelig;a, and
augmented the number of its inhabitants. Demosthenes<a name="FNanchor_555" id="FNanchor_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555" class="fnanchor">555</a>
says that Philistides was appointed by Philip tyrant of the
Oreit&aelig; also, for afterwards the Histi&aelig;ans had that name, and
the city, instead of Histi&aelig;a, was called Oreus. According to
some writers, Histi&aelig;a was colonized by Athenians from the
demus of the Histi&aelig;eis, as Eretria was from the demus of the
Eretrieis. But Theopompus says, that when Pericles had reduced
Eub&#339;a, the Histi&aelig;ans agreed to remove into Macedonia,
and that two thousand Athenians, who formerly composed
the demus of the Histi&aelig;ans, came, and founded Oreus.<a name="FNanchor_556" id="FNanchor_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556" class="fnanchor">556</a></p>

<p>4. It is situated below Mount Telethrius, at a place called
Drymus, near the river Callas, on a lofty rock;<a name="FNanchor_557" id="FNanchor_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor">557</a> whence
perhaps because the Ellopians, the former inhabitants, were a
mountain tribe,<a name="FNanchor_558" id="FNanchor_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor">558</a> the city had the name of Oreus. Orion, who
was brought up there, seems to have had his name from the
place. But according to some writers, the Oreit&aelig;, who had a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
city of their own, being attacked by the Ellopians, migrated,
and settled with the Histi&aelig;ans, and although it was a single
city it had both appellations, as Laced&aelig;mon and Sparta were
the same city. We have said, that the Histi&aelig;otis in Thessaly
had its name from the people who were carried away
from this country by the Perrh&aelig;bi.</p>

<p>5. As Ellopia induced us to commence our description
with Histi&aelig;a and Oreus, we shall proceed with the places continuous
with these.</p>

<p>The promontory Cen&aelig;um is near Oreus, and on the promontory
is situated Dium,<a name="FNanchor_559" id="FNanchor_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559" class="fnanchor">559</a> and Athen&aelig; Diades, a town
founded by Athenians, and overlooks the passage across the
strait to Cynus. Can&aelig; in &AElig;olia received colonists from
Dium. These places are situated near Histi&aelig;a, and besides
these Cerinthus, a small city, close to the sea. Near it is a
river Budorus, of the same name as the mountain in Salamis
on the side of Attica.</p>

<p>6. Carystus<a name="FNanchor_560" id="FNanchor_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor">560</a> lies at the foot of the mountain Oche, and
near it are Styra<a name="FNanchor_561" id="FNanchor_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor">561</a> and Marmarium,<a name="FNanchor_562" id="FNanchor_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">562</a> where is a quarry, from
which are obtained the Carystian columns. It has a temple
of Apollo Marmarinus, where there is a passage across to
Hal&aelig;-Araphenides. At Carystus there is found in the earth
a stone,<a name="FNanchor_563" id="FNanchor_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor">563</a> which is combed like wool, and woven, so that napkins
are made of this substance, which, when soiled, are
thrown into the fire, and cleaned, as in the washing of linen.<a name="FNanchor_564" id="FNanchor_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor">564</a>
These places are said to be inhabited by colonists from the
Tetrapolis of Marathon, and by Steirieis. Styra was destroyed
in the Maliac (Lamiac?) war by Ph&aelig;drus, the general
of the Athenians. But the Eretrians are in possession of the
territory. There is also a Carystus in Laconia, a place belonging
to &AElig;gys, towards Arcadia; from whence comes the
Carystian wine, spoken of by Alcman.</p>

<p>7. Ger&aelig;stus<a name="FNanchor_565" id="FNanchor_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor">565</a> is not mentioned by Homer in the Catalogue
of the Ships; it is however mentioned by him elsewhere;</p>

&#8220;The vessels came to Ger&aelig;stus by night;&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_566" id="FNanchor_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor">566</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>which shows, that the place being near Sunium lies conveniently
for persons who cross from Asia to Attica. It has a
temple of Neptune the most remarkable of any in that
quarter, and a considerable number of inhabitants.</p>

<p>8. Next to Ger&aelig;stus is Eretria, which, after Chalcis, is the
largest city in Eub&#339;a. Next follows Chalcis, the capital as
it were of the island, situated immediately on the Euripus.
Both these cities are said to have been founded by Athenians
before the Trojan war; [but it is also said that] after the
Trojan war, &AElig;clus and Cothus took their departure from
Athens; the former to found Eretria, and Cothus, Chalcis.
A body of &AElig;olians who belonged to the expedition of Penthilus
remained in the island. Anciently, even Arabians<a name="FNanchor_567" id="FNanchor_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor">567</a>
settled there, who came over with Cadmus.</p>

<p>These cities, Eretria and Chalcis, when their population
was greatly augmented, sent out considerable colonies to Macedonia,
for Eretria founded cities about Pallene and Mount
Athos; Chalcis founded some near Olynthus, which Philip
destroyed. There are also many settlements in Italy and
Sicily, founded by Chalcidians. These colonies were sent
out, according to Aristotle,<a name="FNanchor_568" id="FNanchor_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor">568</a> when the government of the
Hippobat&aelig;, (or Knights,) as it is called, was established; it
was an aristocratical government, the heads of which held
their office by virtue of the amount of their property. At
the time that Alexander passed over into Asia, they enlarged
the compass of the walls of their city, including within them
Canethus,<a name="FNanchor_569" id="FNanchor_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor">569</a> and the Euripus, and erected towers upon the
bridge, a wall, and gates.</p>

<p>9. Above the city of the Chalcidians is the plain called
Lelantum, in which are hot springs, adapted to the cure of
diseases, and which were used by Cornelius Sylla, the Roman
general. There was also an extraordinary mine which produced
both copper and iron; such, writers say, is not to be
found elsewhere. At present, however, both are exhausted.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>The whole of Eub&#339;a is subject to earthquakes, especially
the part near the strait. It is also exposed to violent subterraneous
blasts, like B&#339;otia, and other places of which I have
before spoken at length.<a name="FNanchor_570" id="FNanchor_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">570</a> The city of the same name as the
island is said to have been swallowed up by an earthquake.<a name="FNanchor_571" id="FNanchor_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor">571</a>
It is mentioned by &AElig;schylus in his tragedy of Glaucus
Pontius;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;Eubo&iuml;s near the bending shore of Jupiter Cen&aelig;us, close to the tomb of
the wretched Lichas.&#8221;</p>

<p>There is also in &AElig;tolia a town of the name of Chalcis,</p>

<p>speaking of Telemachus and his companions, when they left
Nestor to return to their own country.</p>

<p>10. Some say, that the Eretrians were a colony from Macistus
in Triphylia, under the conduct of Eretrieus; others,
that they came from Eretria, in Attica, where now a market
is held. There is an Eretria also near Pharsalus. In
the Eretrian district there was a city, Tamyn&aelig;, sacred to
Apollo. The temple (which was near the strait) is said to
have been built by Admetus, whom the god, according to
report, served a year<a name="FNanchor_574" id="FNanchor_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574" class="fnanchor">574</a> for hire.</p>

<p>Eretria,<a name="FNanchor_575" id="FNanchor_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575" class="fnanchor">575</a> formerly, had the names of Melane&iuml;s and Arotria.
The village Amarynthus, at the distance of 7 stadia from the
walls, belongs to it.</p>

<p>The Persians razed the ancient city, having enclosed with
multitudes the inhabitants, according to the expression of
Herodotus,<a name="FNanchor_576" id="FNanchor_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor">576</a> in a net, by spreading the Barbarians around the
walls. The foundations are still shown, and the place is
called ancient Eretria. The present city is built near it.</p>

<p>The power which the Eretrians once possessed, is evinced
by a pillar which was placed in the temple of Diana Amarynthia.
There is an inscription on it to this effect, that their
processions upon their public festivals consisted of three
thousand heavy-armed soldiers, six hundred horsemen, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]<br />[CAS. 448]</a></span>
sixty chariots. They were masters, besides other islands, of
Andros, Tenos, and Ceos. They received colonists from
Elis, whence their frequent use of the letter R, (&#961;,)<a name="FNanchor_577" id="FNanchor_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor">577</a> not only
at the end, but in the middle of words, which exposed them
to the raillery of comic writers.</p>

<p>&#338;chalia,<a name="FNanchor_578" id="FNanchor_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578" class="fnanchor">578</a> a village, the remains of a city destroyed by
Hercules, belongs to the district of Eretria. It has the same
name as that in Trachinia, as that near Tricca,<a name="FNanchor_579" id="FNanchor_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579" class="fnanchor">579</a> as that in
Arcadia, (which later writers call Andania,) and as that in
&AElig;tolia near the Eurytanes.</p>

<p>11. At present Chalcis<a name="FNanchor_580" id="FNanchor_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor">580</a> is allowed, without dispute, to hold
the first rank, and is called the capital of the Eub&#339;ans.
Eretria holds the second place. Even in former times these
cities had great influence both in war and peace, so that
they afforded to philosophers an agreeable and tranquil retreat.
A proof of this is the establishment at Eretria of the
school of Eretrian philosophers, disciples of Menedemus; and
at an earlier period the residence of Aristotle<a name="FNanchor_581" id="FNanchor_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">581</a> at Chalcis,
where he also died.</p>

<p>12. These cities generally lived in harmony with each
other, and when a dispute arose between them respecting
Lelantum, they did not even then suspend all intercourse so as
to act in war entirely without regard to each other, but they
agreed upon certain conditions, on which the war was to be
conducted. This appears by a column standing in the Amarynthium,
which interdicts the use of missiles. [For with
respect to warlike usages and armour, there neither is nor
was any common usage; for some nations employ soldiers
who use missile weapons, such as bows, slings, and javelins;
others employ men who engage in close fight, and use a
sword, or charge with a spear.<a name="FNanchor_582" id="FNanchor_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor">582</a> For there are two methods
of using the spear; one is to retain it in the hand; the other,
to hurl it like a dart; the pike<a name="FNanchor_583" id="FNanchor_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor">583</a> answers both purposes, for it
is used in close encounter and is hurled to a distance. The
sarissa and the hyssus are similarly made use of.]<a name="FNanchor_584" id="FNanchor_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor">584</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p>13. The Eub&#339;ans excelled in standing<a name="FNanchor_585" id="FNanchor_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor">585</a> fight, which was
also called close fight,<a name="FNanchor_586" id="FNanchor_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor">586</a> and fight hand to hand.<a name="FNanchor_587" id="FNanchor_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587" class="fnanchor">587</a> They used
spears extended at length according to the words of the poet;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;warriors eager to break through breastplates with extended ashen
spears.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_588" id="FNanchor_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor">588</a></p>

<p>The missile weapons were perhaps of different kinds, as, probably,
was the ashen spear of Pelion, which, as the poet says,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;Achilles alone knew how to hurl.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_589" id="FNanchor_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589" class="fnanchor">589</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>When the poet says,</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;I strike farther with a spear than any other person with an arrow,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_590" id="FNanchor_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_590" class="fnanchor">590</a></p>

<p>he means with a missile spear. They, too, who engage in
single combat, are first introduced as using missile spears, and
then having recourse to swords. But they who engage in
single combat do not use the sword only, but a spear also held
in the hand, as the poet describes it,</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;he wounded him with a polished spear, pointed with brass, and unbraced
his limbs.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_591" id="FNanchor_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591" class="fnanchor">591</a></p>

<p>He represents the Eub&#339;ans as fighting in this manner; but
he describes the Locrian mode as contrary to this;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;It was not their practice to engage in close fight, but they followed him
to Ilium with their bows, clothed in the pliant fleece of the sheep.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_592" id="FNanchor_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592" class="fnanchor">592</a></p>

<p>An answer of an oracle is commonly repeated, which was returned
to the &AElig;gienses;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;a Thessalian horse, a Laced&aelig;monian woman, and the men who drink
the water of the sacred Arethusa,&#8221;</p>

<p>meaning the Chalcideans as superior to all other people, for
Arethusa belongs to them.</p>

<p>14. At present the rivers of Eub&#339;a are the Cereus and
Neleus. The cattle which drink of the water of the former
become white, and those that drink of the water of the latter
become black. We have said that a similar effect is produced
by the water of the Crathis.<a name="FNanchor_593" id="FNanchor_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593" class="fnanchor">593</a></p>

<p>15. As some of the Eub&#339;ans, on their return from Troy,
were driven out of their course among the Illyrians; pursued
their journey homewards through Macedonia, and stopped in
the neighbourhood of Edessa; having assisted the people in a
war, who had received them hospitably; they founded a city,</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]<br />[CAS. 450]</a></span></p>

<p>Eub&#339;a. There was a Eub&#339;a in Sicily, founded by the
Chalcideans, who were settled there. It was destroyed by
Gelon, and became a stronghold of the Syracusans. In Corcyra
also, and at Lemnus, there was a place called Eub&#339;a, and
a hill of this name in the Argive territory.</p>

<p>16. We have said, that &AElig;tolians, Acarnanians, and Athamanes
are situated to the west of the Thessalians and &#338;t&aelig;ans,
if indeed we must call the Athamanes,<a name="FNanchor_594" id="FNanchor_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594" class="fnanchor">594</a> Greeks. It remains,
in order that we may complete the description of
Greece, to give some account of these people, of the islands
which lie nearest to Greece, and are inhabited by Greeks,
which we have not yet mentioned.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">&AElig;tolians</span> and Acarnanians border on one another,
having between them the river Achelous,<a name="FNanchor_595" id="FNanchor_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595" class="fnanchor">595</a> which flows from
the north, and from Pindus towards the south, through the
country of the Agr&aelig;i, an &AElig;tolian tribe, and of the Amphilochians.</p>

<p>Acarnanians occupy the western side of the river as far as
the Ambracian Gulf,<a name="FNanchor_596" id="FNanchor_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596" class="fnanchor">596</a> opposite to the Amphilochians, and the
temple of Apollo Actius. &AElig;tolians occupy the part towards
the east as far as the Locri Ozol&aelig;, Parnassus, and the &#338;t&aelig;ans.</p>

<p>Amphilochians are situated above the Acarnanians in the
interior towards the north; above the Amphilochians are
situated Dolopes, and Mount Pindus; above the &AElig;tolians
are Perrh&aelig;bi, Athamanes, and a body of the &AElig;nianes who
occupy &#338;ta.</p>

<p>The southern side, as well the Acarnanian as the &AElig;tolian,
is washed by the sea, forming the Corinthian Gulf, into which
the Achelous empties itself. This river (at its mouth) is the
boundary of the &AElig;tolian and the Acarnanian coast. The
Achelous was formerly called Thoas. There is a river of
this name near Dyme,<a name="FNanchor_597" id="FNanchor_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597" class="fnanchor">597</a> as we have said, and another near
Lamia.<a name="FNanchor_598" id="FNanchor_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598" class="fnanchor">598</a> We have also said,<a name="FNanchor_599" id="FNanchor_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599" class="fnanchor">599</a> that the mouth of this river is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
considered by some writers as the commencement of the Corinthian
Gulf.</p>

<p>2. The cities of the Acarnanians are, Anactorium, situated
upon a peninsula<a name="FNanchor_600" id="FNanchor_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600" class="fnanchor">600</a> near Actium, and a mart of Nicopolis,
which has been built in our time; Stratus,<a name="FNanchor_601" id="FNanchor_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601" class="fnanchor">601</a> to which vessels
sail up the Achelous, a distance of more than 200 stadia; and
&#338;niad&aelig;<a name="FNanchor_602" id="FNanchor_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602" class="fnanchor">602</a> is also on the banks of the river. The ancient
city is not inhabited, and lies at an equal distance from the
sea and from Stratus. The present city is at the distance of
70 stadia above the mouth of the river.</p>

<p>There are also other cities, Pal&aelig;rus,<a name="FNanchor_603" id="FNanchor_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603" class="fnanchor">603</a> Alyzia,<a name="FNanchor_604" id="FNanchor_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604" class="fnanchor">604</a> Leucas,<a name="FNanchor_605" id="FNanchor_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605" class="fnanchor">605</a> the
Amphilochian Argos,<a name="FNanchor_606" id="FNanchor_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606" class="fnanchor">606</a> and Ambracia:<a name="FNanchor_607" id="FNanchor_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607" class="fnanchor">607</a> most of these, if not
all, are dependent upon Nicopolis.</p>

<p>Stratus lies half-way between Alyzia and Anactorium.<a name="FNanchor_608" id="FNanchor_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608" class="fnanchor">608</a></p>

<p>3. To the &AElig;tolians belong both Calydon<a name="FNanchor_609" id="FNanchor_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609" class="fnanchor">609</a> and Pleuron,
which at present are in a reduced condition, but, anciently,
these settlements were an ornament to Greece.</p>

<p>&AElig;tolia was divided into two portions, one called the
Old, the other the Epictetus (the Acquired). The Old comprised
the sea-coast from the Achelous as far as Calydon, extending
far into the inland parts, which are fertile, and consist
of plains. Here are situated Stratus and Trichonium, which
has an excellent soil. The Epictetus, that reaches close to
the Locri in the direction of Naupactus<a name="FNanchor_610" id="FNanchor_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610" class="fnanchor">610</a> and Eupalium,<a name="FNanchor_611" id="FNanchor_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611" class="fnanchor">611</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]<br />[CAS. 451]</a></span>
is a rugged and sterile tract, extending as far as &#338;t&aelig;a, to
the territory of the Athamanes, and the mountains and nations
following next in order, and which lie around towards
the north.</p>

<p>4. There is in &AElig;tolia a very large mountain, the Corax,<a name="FNanchor_612" id="FNanchor_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612" class="fnanchor">612</a>
which is contiguous to &#338;ta. Among the other mountains,
more in the middle of the country, is the Aracynthus,<a name="FNanchor_613" id="FNanchor_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613" class="fnanchor">613</a> near
which the founders built the modern Pleuron, having abandoned
the ancient city situated near Calydon, which was in
a fertile plain country, when Demetrius, surnamed &AElig;tolicus,
laid waste the district.</p>

<p>Above Molycreia<a name="FNanchor_614" id="FNanchor_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614" class="fnanchor">614</a> are Taphiassus<a name="FNanchor_615" id="FNanchor_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615" class="fnanchor">615</a> and Chalcis,<a name="FNanchor_616" id="FNanchor_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616" class="fnanchor">616</a> mountains
of considerable height, on which are situated the small
cities, Macynia and Chalcis, (having the same name as the
mountain,) or, as it is also called, Hypochalcis. Mount Curium
is near the ancient Pleuron, from which some supposed the
Pleuronii had the appellation of Curetes.</p>

<p>5. The river Evenus rises in the country of the Bomianses,
a nation situated among the Ophienses, and an &AElig;tolian tribe
like the Eurytanes, Agr&aelig;i, Curetes, and others. It does not
flow, at its commencement, through the territory of the Curetes,
which is the same as Pleuronia, but through the country
more towards the east along Chalcis and Calydon; it then
makes a bend backwards to the plains of the ancient Pleuron,
and having changed its course to the west, turns again to the
south, where it empties itself. It was formerly called Lycormas.
There Nessus, who had the post of ferryman, is said
to have been killed by Hercules for having attempted to force
De&iuml;aneira while he was conveying her across the river.</p>

<p>6. The poet calls Olenus and Pylene &AElig;tolian cities, the
former of which, of the same name as the Ach&aelig;an city, was
razed by the &AElig;olians. It is near the new city Pleuron.
The Acarnanians disputed the possession of the territory.
They transferred Pylene to a higher situation, and changed
its name to Proschium. Hellanicus was not at all acquainted
with the history of these cities, but speaks of them as still existing
in their ancient condition, but Macynia and Molycria,
which were built subsequent to the return of the Heracleid&aelig;,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
he enumerates among ancient cities, and shows the greatest
carelessness in almost every part of his work.</p>

<p>7. This, then, is the general account of the country of the
Acarnanians and &AElig;tolians. We must annex to this some
description of the sea-coast and of the islands lying in front
of it.</p>

<p>If we begin from the entrance of the Ambracian Gulf, the
first place we meet with in Acarnania is Actium. The temple
of Apollo Actius has the same name as the promontory, which
forms the entrance of the Gulf, and has a harbour on the
outside.</p>

<p>At the distance of 40 stadia from the temple is Anactorium,
situated on the Gulf; and at the distance of 240 stadia
is Leucas.<a name="FNanchor_617" id="FNanchor_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617" class="fnanchor">617</a></p>

<p>8. This was, anciently, a peninsula belonging to the territory
of the Acarnanians. The poet calls it the coast of
Epirus, meaning by Epirus the country on the other side of
Ithaca,<a name="FNanchor_618" id="FNanchor_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618" class="fnanchor">618</a> and Cephallenia,<a name="FNanchor_619" id="FNanchor_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619" class="fnanchor">619</a> which country is Acarnania; so
that by the words of the poet,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;the coast of Epirus,&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>we must understand the coast of Acarnania.</p>

<p>To Leucas also belonged Neritus, which Laertes said he
took&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;as when I was chief of the Cephallenians, and took Nericus, a well-built
city, on the coast of Epirus,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_620" id="FNanchor_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620" class="fnanchor">620</a></p>

<p>and the cities which he mentions in the Catalogue,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;and they who inhabited Crocyleia, and the rugged &AElig;gilips.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_621" id="FNanchor_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor">621</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But the Corinthians who were despatched by Cypselus and
Gorgus, obtained possession of this coast, and advanced as far
as the Ambracian Gulf. Ambracia and Anactorium were
both founded. They cut through the isthmus of the peninsula,
converted Leucas into an island, transferred Neritus to the
spot, which was once an isthmus, but is now a channel connected
with the land by a bridge, and changed the name to
Leucas from Leucatas, as I suppose, which is a white rock,
projecting from Leucas into the sea towards Cephallenia, so
that it might take its name from this circumstance.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]<br />[CAS. 452]</a></span></p>

<p>9. It has upon it the temple of Apollo Leucatas, and the
Leap, which, it was thought, was a termination of love.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;Here Sappho first &#8217;tis said,&#8221; (according to Menander,) &#8220;in pursuit of
the haughty Phaon, and urged on by maddening desire, threw herself<a name="FNanchor_622" id="FNanchor_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622" class="fnanchor">622</a>
from the aerial rock, imploring Thee, Lord, and King.&#8221;</p>

<p>Menander then says that Sappho was the first who took the
leap, but persons better acquainted with ancient accounts assert
that it was Cephalus, who was in love with Pterelas, the
son of De&iuml;oneus.<a name="FNanchor_623" id="FNanchor_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623" class="fnanchor">623</a> It was also a custom of the country among
the Leucadians at the annual sacrifice performed in honour of
Apollo, to precipitate from the rock one of the condemned
criminals, with a view to avert evil. Various kinds of wings
were attached to him, and even birds were suspended from his
body, to lighten by their fluttering the fall of the leap. Below
many persons were stationed around in small fishing boats
to receive, and to preserve his life, if possible, and to carry
him beyond the boundaries of the country. The author of
the Alcmæonis says that Icarius, the father of Penelope, had
two sons, Alyzeus, and Leucadius, who reigned after their
father in Acarnania, whence Ephorus thinks that the cities
were called after their names.</p>

<p>10. At present those are called Cephallenians who inhabit
Cephallenia. But Homer calls all those under the command
of Ulysses by this name, among whom are the Acarnanians;
for when he says,</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;Ulysses led the Cephallenians, those who possessed Ithaca, and Neritum,
waving with woods,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_624" id="FNanchor_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624" class="fnanchor">624</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<p>and these also were Trojans): but after mentioning Neritum,
he says,</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;and they who inhabited Crocyleia and rocky &AElig;gilips, Zacynthus, Samos,
Epirus, and the country opposite to these islands;&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_629" id="FNanchor_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629" class="fnanchor">629</a></p>

<p>he means by Epirus the country opposite to the islands, intending
to include together with Leucas the rest of Acarnania,
of which he says,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;twelve herds, and as many flocks of sheep in Epirus,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_630" id="FNanchor_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630" class="fnanchor">630</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>because the district of Epirus (the Epirotis) extended anciently
perhaps as far as this place, and was designated by the
common name Epirus.</p>

<p>The present Cephallenia he calls Samos, as when he says,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;in the strait between Ithaca and the hilly Samos,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_631" id="FNanchor_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631" class="fnanchor">631</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>he makes a distinction between places of the same name by an
epithet, assigning the name not to the city, but to the island.
For the island contains four cities, one of which, called Samos,
or Same, for it had either appellation, bore the same name as
the island. But when the poet says,</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;all the chiefs of the islands, Dulichium, Same, and the woody Zacynthus,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_632" id="FNanchor_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632" class="fnanchor">632</a></p>

<p>he is evidently enumerating the islands, and calls that Same
which he had before called Samos.</p>

<p>But Apollodorus at one time says that the ambiguity is removed
by the epithet, which the poet uses, when he says,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;and hilly Samos,&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>meaning the island; and at another time he pretends that we
ought to write</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;Dulichium, and Samos,&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>and not</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;Same,&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>and evidently supposes that the city is called by either name,
Samos or Sam&eacute;, but the island by that of Samos only. That
the city is called Sam&eacute; is evident from the enumeration of
the suitors from each city, where the poet says,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;there are four and twenty from Sam&eacute;,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_633" id="FNanchor_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633" class="fnanchor">633</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>and from what is said about Ctimene,</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]<br />[CAS. 454]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">

&#8220;they afterwards gave her in marriage at Sam&eacute;.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_634" id="FNanchor_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634" class="fnanchor">634</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>There is reason in this. For the poet does not express
himself distinctly either about Cephallenia, or Ithaca, or the
other neighbouring places, so that both historians and commentators
differ from one another.</p>

<p>11. For instance, with respect to Ithaca, when the poet
says,</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;and they who possessed Ithaca, and Neritum with its waving woods,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_635" id="FNanchor_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635" class="fnanchor">635</a></p>

<p>he denotes by the epithet, that he means Neritum the mountain.
In other passages he expressly mentions the mountain;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;I dwell at Ithaca, turned to the western sun; where is a mountain,
Neritum, seen from afar with its waving woods;&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_636" id="FNanchor_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636" class="fnanchor">636</a></p>

<p>but whether he means the city, or the island, is not clear, at
least from this verse;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;they who possessed Ithaca, and Neritum.&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Any one would understand these words in their proper sense
to mean the city, as we speak of Athens, Lycabettus, Rhodes,
Atabyris, Laced&aelig;mon, and Taygetus, but in a poetical sense
the contrary is implied.</p>

<p>In the verses,</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;I dwell at Ithaca, turned to the western sun, in which is a mountain
Neritum,&#8221;</p>

<p>the meaning is plain, because the mountain is on the island
and not in the city; and when he says,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;we came from Ithaca situated under Neium,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_637" id="FNanchor_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637" class="fnanchor">637</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>it is uncertain whether he means that Neium was the same as
Neritum, or whether it is another, either mountain or place.
[He, who writes Nericum for Neritum, or the reverse, is
quite mistaken. For the poet describes the former as &#8220;waving
with woods;&#8221; the other as a &#8220;well-built city;&#8221; one in Ithaca,
the other on the sea-beach of Epirus.]<a name="FNanchor_638" id="FNanchor_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638" class="fnanchor">638</a></p>

<p>12. But this line seems to imply some contradiction;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;it lies in the sea both low, and very high,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_639" id="FNanchor_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639" class="fnanchor">639</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>for &#967;&#952;&#945;&#956;&#945;&#955;&#8052; is low, and depressed, but &#960;&#945;&#957;&#965;&#960;&#949;&#961;&#964;&#8049;&#964;&#951; expresses
great height, as he describes it in other passages, calling it
Cranae, (or rugged,) and the road leading from the harbour,
as,</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

&#8220;a rocky way through a woody spot,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_640" id="FNanchor_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640" class="fnanchor">640</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>and again,</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;for there is not any island in the sea exposed to the western sun,<a name="FNanchor_641" id="FNanchor_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641" class="fnanchor">641</a> and
with good pastures, least of all Ithaca.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_642" id="FNanchor_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642" class="fnanchor">642</a></p>

<p>The expression does imply contradictions, which admit however
of some explanation. They do not understand &#967;&#952;&#945;&#956;&#945;&#955;&#8052;
to signify in that place &#8220;low,&#8221; but its contiguity to the continent,
to which it approaches very close; nor by &#960;&#945;&#957;&#965;&#960;&#949;&#961;&#964;&#8049;&#964;&#951;
great elevation, but the farthest advance towards darkness,
(&#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#950;&#8057;&#966;&#959;&#957;,) that is, placed towards the north more than all
the other islands, for this is what the poet means by &#8220;towards
darkness,&#8221; the contrary to which is towards the south, (&#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#957;&#8057;&#964;&#959;&#957;,)</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;the rest far off (&#7940;&#957;&#949;&#965;&#952;&#949;) towards the morning, and the sun.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_643" id="FNanchor_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643" class="fnanchor">643</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>For the word &#7940;&#957;&#949;&#965;&#952;&#949; denotes &#8220;at a distance,&#8221; and &#8220;apart,&#8221; as
if the other islands lay to the south, and more distant from the
continent, but Ithaca near the continent and towards the north.
That the poet designates the southern part (of the heavens) in
this manner appears from these words,</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;whether they go to the right hand, towards the morning and the sun, or
to the left, towards cloudy darkness;&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_644" id="FNanchor_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644" class="fnanchor">644</a></p>

<p>and still more evidently in these lines,</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;my friends, we know not where darkness nor where morning lie, nor
where sets nor where rises the sun which brings light to man.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_645" id="FNanchor_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645" class="fnanchor">645</a></p>

<p>We may here understand the four climates,<a name="FNanchor_646" id="FNanchor_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646" class="fnanchor">646</a> and suppose the
morning to denote the southern part (of the heavens), and
this has some probability; but it is better to consider what
is near to the path of the sun to be opposite to the northern
part (of the heavens). For the speech in Homer is intended
to indicate some great change in the celestial appearances, not
a mere obscuration of the <i>climates</i>. For this must happen
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]<br />[CAS. 455]</a></span>
during every cloudy season either by day or by night. Now
the celestial appearances alter very much as we advance more
or less towards the south, or the contrary; but this alteration
does not prevent our observing the setting and rising of the
sun, for in fine weather these phenomena are always visible
whether in the south or the north. For the pole is the most
northerly point: when this moves, and is sometimes over our
heads and sometimes below the earth, the arctic circles change
their position with it. Sometimes they disappear during
these movements, so that you cannot discern the position of
the northern <i>climate</i>, nor where it commences;<a name="FNanchor_647" id="FNanchor_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647" class="fnanchor">647</a> and if this
is so, neither can you distinguish the contrary <i>climate</i>.</p>

<p>The circuit of Ithaca is about 80<a name="FNanchor_648" id="FNanchor_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648" class="fnanchor">648</a> stadia. So much then
concerning Ithaca.</p>

<p>13. The poet does not mention Cephallenia, which contains
four cities, by its present name, nor any of the cities except
one, either Sam&eacute; or Samos, which no longer exists, but traces
of it are shown in the middle of the Strait near Ithaca. The
inhabitants have the name of Sam&aelig;. The rest still exist at
present, they are small cities, Paleis, Pronesus, and Cranii.
In our time Caius Antonius, the uncle of Marcus Antonius,
founded an additional city, when (being an exile after his consulship
in which he was the colleague of Cicero the orator) he
lived at Cephallenia, and was master of the whole island, as
if it had been his own property. He returned from exile before
he completed the foundation of the settlement, and died
when engaged in more important affairs.</p>

<p>14. Some writers do not hesitate to affirm, that Cephallenia
and Dulichium are the same; others identify it with Taphos,
and the Cephallenians with Taphians, and these again with
Telebo&aelig;. They assert that Amphitryon, with the aid of Cephalus,
the son of De&iuml;oneus, an exile from Athens, undertook
an expedition against the island, and having got possession of
it, delivered it up to Cephalus; hence this city bore his name,
and the rest those of his children. But this is not in accordance
with Homer, for the Cephallenians were subject to
Ulysses and Laertes, and Taphos to Mentes;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;I boast that I am Mentes, son of the valiant Anchialus,</div>

</div></div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p>Taphos is now called Taphius.<a name="FNanchor_650" id="FNanchor_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650" class="fnanchor">650</a> Nor does Hellanicus follow
Homer when he calls Cephallenia, Dulichium, for Dulichium,
and the other Echinades, are said to be under the command
of Meges, and the inhabitants, Epeii, who came from Elis;
wherefore he calls Otus the Cyllenian,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">

</div></div></div>

<p>Neither, as Andro asserts, is Cephallenia, according to Homer,
Dulichium, nor does Dulichium belong to Cephallenia, for
Epeii possessed Dulichium, and Cephallenians the whole of
Cephallenia, the former of whom were under the command
of Ulysses, the latter of Meges. Paleis is not called Dulichium
by Homer, as Pherecydes says. But he who asserts
that Cephallenia and Dulichium are the same contradicts
most strongly the account of Homer; for as fifty-two of the
suitors came from Dulichium, and twenty-four from Sam&eacute;,
would he not say, that from the whole island came such a
number of suitors, and from a single city of the four came
half the number within two? If any one should admit this,
we shall inquire what the Sam&eacute; could be, which is mentioned
in this line,</p>

<p>15. Cephallenia is situated opposite to Acarnania, at the distance
from Leucatas of about 50, or according to others, of 40
stadia, and from Chelonatas<a name="FNanchor_654" id="FNanchor_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654" class="fnanchor">654</a> of about 80 stadia. It is about 300
stadia (1300?) in circumference. It extends in length towards
the south-east (Eurus). It is mountainous; the largest mountain
in it is the &AElig;nus,<a name="FNanchor_655" id="FNanchor_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655" class="fnanchor">655</a> on which is the temple of Jupiter
&AElig;nesius. Here is the narrowest part of the island, which forms
a low isthmus, that is frequently overflowed from sea to sea.<a name="FNanchor_656" id="FNanchor_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_656" class="fnanchor">656</a>

&#8220;there are harbours in it, open on both sides, for the reception of vessels.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_660" id="FNanchor_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660" class="fnanchor">660</a>
</p>

<p>But Apollodorus says that it exists even at present, and mentions
a small city in it, Alalcomen&aelig;, situated quite upon the
isthmus.</p>

<p><a name="x_ii_17" id="x_ii_17"></a>17. The poet also gives the name of Samos to Thracia,
which we now call Samothrac&eacute;. He was probably acquainted
with the Ionian island, for he seems to have been acquainted
with the Ionian migration. He would not, otherwise, have
made a distinction between islands of the same names, for in
speaking of Samothrace, he makes the distinction sometimes
by the epithet,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

&#8220;on high, upon the loftiest summit of the woody Samos, the Thracian,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_661" id="FNanchor_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661" class="fnanchor">661</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>sometimes by uniting it with the neighbouring islands,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">

&#8220;to Samos, and Imbros, and inaccessible Lemnos;&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_662" id="FNanchor_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_662" class="fnanchor">662</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>and again,</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>He was therefore acquainted with the Ionian island, although
he has not mentioned its name. Nor had it formerly always
the same name, but was called Melamphylus, then Anthemis,
then Parthenia, from the river Parthenius, the name of which
was changed to Imbrasus. Since then both Cephallenia and
Samothrac&eacute; were called Samos<a name="FNanchor_664" id="FNanchor_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_664" class="fnanchor">664</a> at the time of the Trojan
war, (for if it had not been so Hecuba would not have been
introduced saying, that Achilles would sell any of her children
that he could seize at Samos and Imbros,<a name="FNanchor_665" id="FNanchor_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_665" class="fnanchor">665</a>) Ionian Samos
was not yet colonized (by Ionians), which is evident from its
having the same name from one of the islands earlier (called
Samos), that had it before; whence this also is clear, that
those persons contradict ancient history, who assert, that
colonists came from Samos after the Ionian migration, and
the arrival of Tembrion, and gave the name of Samos to
Samothrac&eacute;. The Samians invented this story out of vanity.
Those are more entitled to credit, who say, that heights are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
called Sami,<a name="FNanchor_666" id="FNanchor_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_666" class="fnanchor">666</a> and that the island obtained its name from this
circumstance, for from thence</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;was seen all Ida, the city of Priam, and the ships of the Greeks.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_667" id="FNanchor_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_667" class="fnanchor">667</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But according to some writers, Samos had its name from the
Saii, a Thracian tribe, who formerly inhabited it, and who occupied
also the adjoining continent, whether they were the
same people as the Sap&aelig;, or the Sinti, whom the poet calls
Sinties, or a different nation. Archilochus mentions the
Saii;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;one of the Saii is exulting in the possession of an honourable shield,
which I left against my will near a thicket.&#8221;</p>

<p>18. Of the islands subject to Ulysses there remains to be
described Zacynthus.<a name="FNanchor_668" id="FNanchor_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668" class="fnanchor">668</a> It verges a little more than Cephallenia
to the west of Peloponnesus, but approaches closer to it.
It is 160 stadia in circumference, and distant from Cephallenia
about 60 stadia. It is woody, but fertile, and has a considerable
city of the same name. Thence to the Hesperides belonging
to Africa are 3300<a name="FNanchor_669" id="FNanchor_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669" class="fnanchor">669</a> stadia.</p>

<p>19. To the east of this island, and of Cephallenia, are situated
the Echinades<a name="FNanchor_670" id="FNanchor_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670" class="fnanchor">670</a> islands; among which is Dulichium, at
present called Dolicha, and the islands called Oxei&aelig;, to which
the poet gives the name of Tho&aelig;.<a name="FNanchor_671" id="FNanchor_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_671" class="fnanchor">671</a></p>

<p>Dolicha is situated opposite to the &#338;niad&aelig;, and the mouth
of the Achelous: it is distant from Araxus,<a name="FNanchor_672" id="FNanchor_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_672" class="fnanchor">672</a> the promontory
of Elis, 100 stadia. The rest of the Echinades are numerous,
they are all barren and rocky, and lie in front of the mouth
of the Achelous, the most remote of them at the distance of
15, the nearest at the distance of 5 stadia; they formerly
were farther out at sea, but the accumulation of earth, which
is brought down in great quantity by the Achelous, has already
joined some, and will join others, to the continent. This
accumulation of soil anciently formed the tract Paracheloitis,
which the river overflows, a subject of contention, as it was
continually confounding boundaries, which had been determined
by the Acarnanians and the &AElig;tolians. For want of
arbitrators they decided their dispute by arms. The most
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]<br />[CAS. 458]</a></span>
powerful gained the victory. This gave occasion to a fable,
how Hercules overcame the Achelous in fight, and received in
marriage as the prize of his victory, De&iuml;aneira, daughter of
&#338;neus. Sophocles introduces her, saying,</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;My suitor was a river, I mean the Achelous, who demanded me of my
father under three forms; one while coming as a bull of perfect form,
another time as a spotted writhing serpent, at another with the body of a
man and the forehead of a bull.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_673" id="FNanchor_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_673" class="fnanchor">673</a></p>

<p>Some writers add, that this was the horn of Amaltheia, which
Hercules broke off from the Achelous, and presented to
&#338;neus as a bridal gift. Others, conjecturing the truth included
in this story, say, that Achelous is reported to have
resembled a bull, like other rivers, in the roar of their waters,
and the bendings of their streams, which they term horns;
and a serpent from its length and oblique course; and bull-fronted
because it was compared to a bull&#8217;s head; and that
Hercules, who, on other occasions, was disposed to perform
acts of kindness for the public benefit, so particularly, when he
was desirous of contracting an alliance with &#338;neus, performed
for him these services; he prevented the river from overflowing
its banks, by constructing mounds and by diverting its
streams by canals, and by draining a large tract of the Parachelo&iuml;tis,
which had been injured by the river; and this is the
horn of Amaltheia.</p>

<p>Homer says, that in the time of the Trojan war the Echinades,
and the Oxei&aelig; were subject to Meges,</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;son of the hero Phyleus, beloved of Jupiter, who formerly repaired to
Dulichium on account of a quarrel with his father.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_674" id="FNanchor_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674" class="fnanchor">674</a></p>

<p>The father of Phyleus was Augeas, king of Elis, and of the
Epeii. The Epeii then, who possessed these islands, were
those who had migrated to Dulichium with Phyleus.</p>

<p>20. The islands of the Taphii, and formerly of the Telebo&aelig;,
among which was Taphus, now called Taphius, were
distinct from the Echinades, not separated by distance, (for
they lie near one another,) but because they were ranged under
different chiefs, Taphii and Telebo&aelig;. In earlier times
Amphitryon, in conjunction with Cephalus, the son of De&iuml;oneus,
an exile from Athens, attacked, and then delivered them
up to the government of Cephalus. But the poet says that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
Mentes was their chief, and calls them robbers, which was
the character of all the Telebo&aelig;.</p>

<p>So much then concerning the islands off Acarnania.</p>

<p>21. Between Leucas and the Ambracian gulf is a sea-lake,
called Myrtuntium.<a name="FNanchor_675" id="FNanchor_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675" class="fnanchor">675</a> Next to Leucas followed Pal&aelig;rus, and
Alyzia, cities of Acarnania, of which Alyzia is distant from
the sea 15 stadia. Opposite to it is a harbour sacred to Hercules,
and a grove from whence a Roman governor transported
to Rome &#8220;the labours of Hercules,&#8221; the workmanship
of Lysippus, which was lying in an unsuitable place, being a
deserted spot.<a name="FNanchor_676" id="FNanchor_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676" class="fnanchor">676</a></p>

<p>Next are Crithote,<a name="FNanchor_677" id="FNanchor_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_677" class="fnanchor">677</a> a promontory, and the Echinades, and
Astacus, used in the singular number, a city of the same name
as that near Nicomedia, and the Gulf of Astacus, Crithote, a
city of the same name as that in the Thracian Chersonesus.
All the coast between these places has good harbours. Then
follows &#338;niad&aelig;, and the Achelous; then a lake belonging to
the &#338;niad&aelig;, called Melite, 30 stadia in length, and in breadth
20; then another Cynia, of double the breadth and length of
Melite; a third Uria,<a name="FNanchor_678" id="FNanchor_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_678" class="fnanchor">678</a> much less than either of the former.
Cynia even empties itself into the sea; the others are situated
above it at the distance of about half a stadium.</p>

<p>Next is the river Evenus, which is distant from Actium
670 stadia.</p>

<p>Then follows the mountain Chalcis, which Artemidorus
calls Chalcia; [next Pleuron, then Licyrna, a village, above
which in the interior is situated Calydon at the distance of 30
stadia. Near Calydon is the temple of Apollo Laphrius;]<a name="FNanchor_679" id="FNanchor_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_679" class="fnanchor">679</a>
then the mountain Taphiassus; then Macynia, a city; then
Molycria, and near it Antirrhium, the boundary of &AElig;tolia
and of Locris. To Antirrhium from the Evenus are about
120 stadia.</p>

<p>Artemidorus does not place the mountain, whether Chalcis
or Chalcia, between the Achelous and Pleuron, but Apollodorus,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]<br />[CAS. 460]</a></span>
as I have said before, places Chalcis and Taphiassus
above Molycria; and Calydon between Pleuron and Chalcis.
Are we then to place one mountain of the name of Chalcia
near Pleuron, and another of the name of Chalcis near
Molycria?</p>

<p>Near Calydon is a large lake, abounding with fish. It belongs
to the Romans of Patr&aelig;.</p>

<p>22. Apollodorus says, that there is in the inland parts of
Acarnania, a tribe of Erysich&aelig;i, mentioned by Aleman,</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;not an Erysich&aelig;an, nor a shepherd; but I came from the extremities
of Sardis.&#8221;</p>

<p>Olenus belonged to &AElig;tolia; Homer mentions it in the &AElig;tolian
Catalogue,<a name="FNanchor_680" id="FNanchor_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_680" class="fnanchor">680</a> but traces alone remain of it near Pleuron
below Aracynthus.<a name="FNanchor_681" id="FNanchor_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_681" class="fnanchor">681</a></p>

<p>Lysimachia also was near Olenus. This place has disappeared.
It was situated upon the lake, the present Lysimachia,
formerly Hydra, between Pleuron and the city Arsino&euml;,<a name="FNanchor_682" id="FNanchor_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_682" class="fnanchor">682</a>
formerly a village of the name of Conopa. It was founded by
Arsino&euml;, wife and also sister of the second Ptolemy. It is
conveniently situated above the passage across the Achelous.</p>

<p>Pylene has experienced nearly the same fate as Olenus.</p>

<p>When the poet describes Calydon<a name="FNanchor_683" id="FNanchor_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_683" class="fnanchor">683</a> as lofty, and rocky, we
must understand these epithets as relating to the character of
the country. For we have said before, that when they divided
the country into two parts, they assigned the mountainous
portion and the Epictetus<a name="FNanchor_684" id="FNanchor_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_684" class="fnanchor">684</a> to Calydon, and the tract of
plains to Pleuron.</p>

<p>23. The Acarnanians, and the &AElig;tolians, like many other
nations, are at present worn out, and exhausted by continual
wars. The &AElig;tolians however, in conjunction with the Acarnanians,
during a long period withstood the Macedonians and
the other Greeks, and lastly the Romans, in their contest for
independence.</p>

<p>But since Homer, and others, both poets and historians,
frequently mention them, sometimes in clear and undisputed
terms, and sometimes less explicitly, as appears from what we
have already said of these people, we must avail ourselves of
some of the more ancient accounts, which will supply us with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
a beginning, or with an occasion of inquiring into what is
controverted.</p>

<p>24. First then with respect to Acarnania. We have already
said, that it was occupied by Laertes and the Cephallenians;
but as many writers have advanced statements respecting
the first occupants in terms sufficiently clear, indeed, but
contradictory, the inquiry and discussion are left open to us.</p>

<p>They say, that the Taphii and Telebo&aelig;, as they are called,
were the first inhabitants of Acarnania, and that their chief,
Cephalus, who was appointed by Amphitryon sovereign of the
islands about Taphus, was master also of this country. Hence
is related of him the fable, that he was the first person who
took the reputed leap from Leucatas. But the poet does not
say, that the Taphii inhabited Acarnania before the arrival of
the Cephallenians and Laertes, but that they were friends of
the Ithacenses; consequently, in his time, either they had
not the entire command of these places, or had voluntarily retired,
or had even become joint settlers.</p>

<p>A colony of certain from Laced&aelig;mon seems to have settled
in Acarnania, who were followers of Icarius, father of Penelope,
for the poet in the Odyssey represents him and the
brothers of Penelope as then living;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;who did not dare to go to the palace of Icarius with a view of his disposing
of his daughter in marriage.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_685" id="FNanchor_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685" class="fnanchor">685</a></p>

<p>And with respect to the brothers;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;for now a long time both her father and her brothers were urging her
to marry Eurymachus.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_686" id="FNanchor_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_686" class="fnanchor">686</a></p>

<p>Nor is it probable that they were living at Laced&aelig;mon, for
Telemachus would not, in that case, have been the guest of
Menelaus upon his arrival, nor is there a tradition, that they
had any other habitation. But they say that Tyndareus and
his brother Icarius, after being banished from their own
country by Hippocoon, repaired to Thestius, the king of the
Pleuronii, and assisted in obtaining possession of a large
tract of country on the other side of the Achelous on condition
of receiving a portion of it; that Tyndareus, having
espoused Leda the daughter of Thestius, returned home; that
Icarius continued there in possession of a portion of Acarnania,
and had Penelope and her brothers by his wife Polycasta,
daughter of Lyg&aelig;us.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]<br />[CAS. 461]</a></span></p>

<p>We have shown by the Catalogue of the Ships in Homer,
that the Acarnanians were enumerated among the people who
took part in the war of Troy; and among these are reckoned
the inhabitants of the Act&eacute;, and besides these,</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">&#8220;they who occupied Epirus, and cultivated the land opposite.&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But Epirus was never called Acarnania, nor Act&eacute;, Leucas.</p>

<p>25. Ephorus does not say that they took part in the expedition
against Troy; but he says that Alcm&aelig;on, the son of
Amphiaraus, who was the companion of Diomede, and the
other Epigoni in their expedition, having brought the war
against the Thebans to a successful issue, went with Diomede
to assist in punishing the enemies of &#338;neus, and having delivered
up &AElig;tolia to Diomede, he himself passed over into
Acarnania, which country also he subdued. In the mean
time Agamemnon attacked the Argives, and easily overcame
them, the greatest part having attached themselves to the followers
of Diomede. But a short time afterwards, when the
expedition took place against Troy, he was afraid, lest, in his
absence with the army, Diomede and his troops should return
home, (for there was a rumour that he had collected a large
force,) and should regain possession of a territory to which
they had the best right, one being the heir of Adrastus, the
other of his father. Reflecting then on these circumstances,
he invited them to unite in the recovery of Argos, and to
take part in the war. Diomede consented to take part in the
expedition, but Alcm&aelig;on was indignant and refused; whence
the Acarnanians were the only people who did not participate
in the expedition with the Greeks. The Acarnanians,
probably by following this account, are said to have imposed
upon the Romans, and to have obtained from them the privilege
of an independent state, because they alone had not
taken part in the expedition against the ancestors of the Romans,
for their names are neither in the &AElig;tolian Catalogue,
nor are they mentioned by themselves, nor is their name
mentioned anywhere in the poem.</p>

<p>26. Ephorus then having represented Acarnania as subject
to Alcm&aelig;on before the Trojan war, ascribes to him the foundation
of Amphilochian Argos, and says that Acarnania had
its name from his son Acarnan, and the Amphilochians from
his brother Amphilochus; thus he turns aside to reports contrary
to the history in Homer. But Thucydides and other
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
writers say, that Amphilochus, on his return from the Trojan
expedition, being displeased with the state of affairs at Argos,
dwelt in this country; according to some writers, he obtained
it by succeeding to the dominions of his brother; others represent
it differently. So much then respecting the Acarnanians
considered by themselves. We shall now speak of their
affairs where they are intermixed in common with those of
the &AElig;tolians, and we shall then relate as much of the history
of the &AElig;tolians as we proposed to add to our former account
of this people.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Some</span> writers reckon the Curetes among the Acarnanians,
others among the &AElig;tolians; some allege that they came
from Crete, others that they came from Eub&#339;a. Since,
however, they are mentioned by Homer, we must first examine
his account of them. It is thought that he does not
mean the Acarnanians, but the &AElig;tolians, in the following
verses, for the sons of Porthaon were,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;Agrius, Melas, and the hero &#338;neus,</div>
<div class="line">These dwelt at Pleuron, and the lofty Calydon,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_687" id="FNanchor_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_687" class="fnanchor">687</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>both of which are &AElig;tolian cities, and are mentioned in the
&AElig;tolian Catalogue; wherefore since those who inhabited
Pleuron appear to be, according to Homer, Curetes, they
might be &AElig;tolians. The opponents of this conclusion are
misled by the mode of expression in these verses,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;Curetes and &AElig;tolians, firm in battle, were righting for the city Calydon,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_688" id="FNanchor_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_688" class="fnanchor">688</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>for neither would he have used appropriate terms if he had
said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;B&#339;otians and Thebans were contending against each other,&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>nor</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;Argives and Peloponnesians.&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But we have shown in a former part of this work, that this
mode of expression is usual with Homer, and even trite among
other poets. This objection then is easily answered. But
let the objectors explain, how, if these people were not &AElig;tolians,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]<br />[CAS. 463]</a></span>
the poet came to reckon the Pleuronii among the &AElig;tolians.</p>

<p>2. Ephorus, after having asserted that the nation of the
&AElig;tolians were never in subjection to any other people, but,
from all times of which any memorial remains, their country
continued exempt from the ravages of war, both on account of
its local obstacles and their own experience in warfare, says,
that from the beginning Curetes were in possession of the
whole country, but on the arrival of &AElig;t&#333;lus, the son of Endymion,
from Elis, who defeated them in various battles, the
Curetes retreated to the present Acarnania, and the &AElig;tolians
returned with a body of Epeii, and founded ten of the most
ancient cities in &AElig;tolia; and in the tenth generation afterwards
Elis was founded, in conjunction with that people, by
Oxylus, the son of H&aelig;mon, who had passed over from &AElig;tolia.
They produce, as proofs of these facts, inscriptions, one
sculptured on the base of the statue of &AElig;tolus at Therma in
&AElig;tolia, where, according to the custom of the country, they
assemble to elect their magistrates;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;this statue of &AElig;tolus, son of Endymion, brought up near the streams of
the Alpheius, and in the neighbourhood of the stadia of Olympia, &AElig;tolians
dedicated as a public monument of his merits.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the other inscription on the statue of Oxylus is in the
market-place of Elis;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;&AElig;tolus, having formerly abandoned the original inhabitants of this
country, won by the toils of war the land of the Curetes. But Oxylus,
the son of H&aelig;mon, the tenth scion of that race, founded this ancient
city.&#8221;</p>

<p>3. He rightly alleges, as a proof of the affinity subsisting
reciprocally between the Eleii and the &AElig;tolians, these inscriptions,
both of which recognise not the affinity alone, but
also that their founders had established settlers in each other&#8217;s
country. Whence he clearly convicts those of falsehood who
assert, that the Eleii were a colony of &AElig;tolians, and that the
&AElig;tolians were not a colony of Eleii. But he seems to exhibit
the same inconsistency in his positions here, that we
proved<a name="FNanchor_689" id="FNanchor_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_689" class="fnanchor">689</a> with regard to the oracle at Delphi. For after asserting
that &AElig;tolia had never been ravaged by war from all
time of which there was any memorial, and saying, that from
the first the Curetes were in possession of this country, he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
ought to have inferred from such premises, that the Curetes
continued to occupy the country of &AElig;tolia to his days. For
in this manner it might be understood never to have been
devastated, nor in subjection to any other nation. But forgetting
his position, he does not infer this, but the contrary,
that &AElig;tolus came from Elis, and having defeated the Curetes
in various battles, these people retreated into Acarnania.
What else then is there peculiar to the devastation of a country
than the defeat of the inhabitants in war and their abandonment
of their land, which is evinced by the inscription among
the Eleii; for speaking of &AElig;tolus the words are,</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;he obtained possession of the country of the Curetes by the continued
toils of war.&#8221;</p>

<p>4. But perhaps some person may say, that he means &AElig;tolia
was not laid waste, reckoning from the time that it had this
name after the arrival of &AElig;tolus; but he takes away the
ground of this supposition, by saying afterwards, that the
greatest part of the people, that remained among the &AElig;tolians,
were those called Epeii, with whom &AElig;tolians were afterwards
intermingled, who had been expelled from Thessaly
together with B&#339;otians, and possessed the country in common
with these people. But is it probable that, without any hostilities,
they invaded the country of another nation and
divided it among themselves and the original possessors,
who did not require such a partition of their land? If this is
not probable, is it to be believed that the victors agreed to an
equal division of the territory? What else then is devastation
of a country, but the conquest of it by arms? Besides, Apollodorus
says that, according to history, the Hyantes abandoned
B&#339;otia and came and settled among the &AElig;tolians, and
concludes as confident that his opinion is right by saying it is
our custom to relate these and similar facts exactly, whenever
any of them is altogether dubious, or concerning which
erroneous opinions are entertained.</p>

<p>5. Notwithstanding these faults in Ephorus, still he is
superior to other writers. Polybius himself, who has studiously
given him so much praise, has said that Eudoxus has
written well on Grecian affairs, but that Ephorus has given
the best account of the foundation of cities, of the relationship
subsisting between nations, of changes of settlements, and of
leaders of colonies, in these words, &#8220;but I shall explain the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]<br />[CAS. 465]</a></span>
present state of places, both as to position and distances; for
this is the peculiar province of chorography.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_690" id="FNanchor_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_690" class="fnanchor">690</a></p>

<p>But you, Polybius, who introduce popular hearsay, and
rumours on the subject of distances, not only of places beyond
Greece, but in Greece itself, have you not been called to
answer the charges sometimes of Posidonius, sometimes of
Artemidorus, and of many other writers? ought you not therefore
to excuse us, and not to be offended, if in transferring
into our own work a large part of the historical poets from
such writers we commit some errors, and to commend us when
we are generally more exact in what we say than others, or
supply what they omitted through want of information.</p>

<p>6. With respect to the Curetes, some facts are related
which belong more immediately, some more remotely, to the
history of the &AElig;tolians and Acarnanians. The facts more
immediately relating to them, are those which have been
mentioned before, as that the Curetes were living in the
country which is now called &AElig;tolia, and that a body of
&AElig;tolians under the command of &AElig;tolus came there, and drove
them into Acarnania; and these facts besides, that &AElig;olians
invaded Pleuronia, which was inhabited by Curetes, and
called Curetis, took away their territory, and expelled the
possessors.</p>

<p>But Archemachus<a name="FNanchor_691" id="FNanchor_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_691" class="fnanchor">691</a> of Eub&#339;a says that the Curetes had
their settlement at Chalcis, but being continually at war about
the plain Lelantum, and finding that the enemy used to seize
and drag them by the hair of the forehead, they wore their
hair long behind, and cut the hair short in front, whence they
had the name of Curetes, (or the shorn,) from cura, (&#954;&#959;&#965;&#961;&#8049;,)
or the tonsure which they had undergone; that they removed
to &AElig;tolia, and occupied the places about Pleuron; that
others, who lived on the other side of the Achelous, because
they kept their heads unshorn, were called Acarnanians.<a name="FNanchor_692" id="FNanchor_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_692" class="fnanchor">692</a></p>

<p>But according to some writers each tribe derived its name
from some hero;<a name="FNanchor_693" id="FNanchor_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_693" class="fnanchor">693</a> according to others, that they had the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
name of Curetes from the mountain Curium,<a name="FNanchor_694" id="FNanchor_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_694" class="fnanchor">694</a> which is situated
above Pleuron, and that this is an &AElig;tolian tribe, like the
Ophieis, Agr&aelig;i, Eurytanes, and many others.</p>

<p>But, as we have before said, when &AElig;tolia was divided into
two parts, the country about Calydon was said to be in the
possession of &#338;neus; and a portion of Pleuronia in that of
the Porthaonid&aelig; of the branch of Agrius,<a name="FNanchor_695" id="FNanchor_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_695" class="fnanchor">695</a> for</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>Thestius however, father-in-law of &#338;neus, and father of
Alth&aelig;a, chief of the Curetes, was master of Pleuronia. But
when war broke out between the Thestiad&aelig;, &#338;neus, and
Meleager about a boar&#8217;s head and skin, according to the poet,<a name="FNanchor_697" id="FNanchor_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697" class="fnanchor">697</a>
following the fable concerning the boar of Calydon, but, as is
probable, the dispute related to a portion of the territory; the
words are these,</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>These then are the facts more immediately connected (with
geography).</p>

<p>7. There<a name="FNanchor_699" id="FNanchor_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_699" class="fnanchor">699</a> are others more remote from the subject of this

work, which have been erroneously placed by historians
under one head on account of the sameness of name: for instance,
accounts relating to &#8220;Curetic affairs&#8221; and &#8220;concerning
the Curetes&#8221; have been considered as identical with accounts
&#8220;concerning the people (of the same name) who inhabited
&AElig;tolia and Acarnania.&#8221; But the former differ from the
latter, and resemble rather the accounts which we have of
Satyri and Silenes, Bacch&aelig; and Tityri; for the Curetes are
represented as certain d&aelig;mons, or ministers of the gods, by
those who have handed down the traditions respecting Cretan
and Phrygian affairs, and which involve certain religious
rites, some mystical, others the contrary, relative to the nurture
of Jupiter in Crete; the celebration of orgies in honour
of the mother of the gods, in Phrygia, and in the neighbourhood
of the Trojan Ida. There is however a very great
variety<a name="FNanchor_700" id="FNanchor_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_700" class="fnanchor">700</a> in these accounts. According to some, the Corybantes,
Cabeiri, Id&aelig;an Dactyli, and Telchines are represented
as the same persons as the Curetes; according to
others, they are related to, yet distinguished from, each other
by some slight differences; but to describe them in general
terms and more at length, they are inspired with an enthusiastic
and Bacchic frenzy, which is exhibited by them as ministers
at the celebration of the sacred rites, by inspiring terror
with armed dances, accompanied with the tumult and noise
of cymbals, drums, and armour, and with the sound of pipes
and shouting; so that these sacred ceremonies are nearly the
same as those that are performed among the Samothracians
in Lemnus, and in many other places; since the ministers of
the god are said to be the same.<a name="FNanchor_701" id="FNanchor_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_701" class="fnanchor">701</a> The whole of this kind of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
discussion is of a theological nature, and is not alien to the
contemplation of the philosopher.</p>

<p>8. But since even the historians, through the similarity of
the name Curetes, have collected into one body a mass of dissimilar
facts, I myself do not hesitate to speak of them at
length by way of digression, adding the physical considerations
which belong to the history.<a name="FNanchor_702" id="FNanchor_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_702" class="fnanchor">702</a> Some writers however endeavour
to reconcile one account with the other, and perhaps
they have some degree of probability in their favour. They
say, for instance, that the people about &AElig;tolia have the name
of Curetes from wearing long dresses like girls, (&#954;&#8057;&#961;&#945;&#953;,) and
that there was, among the Greeks, a fondness for some such
fashion. The Ionians also were called &#8220;tunic-trailers,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_703" id="FNanchor_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_703" class="fnanchor">703</a> and
the soldiers of Leonidas,<a name="FNanchor_704" id="FNanchor_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_704" class="fnanchor">704</a> who went out to battle with their
hair dressed, were despised by the Persians, but subjects of
their admiration in the contest. In short, the application
of art to the hair consists in attending to its growth, and the
manner of cutting it,<a name="FNanchor_705" id="FNanchor_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_705" class="fnanchor">705</a> and both these are the peculiar care of
girls and youths;<a name="FNanchor_706" id="FNanchor_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_706" class="fnanchor">706</a> whence in several ways it is easy to find a
derivation of the name Curetes. It is also probable, that the
practice of armed dances, first introduced by persons who
paid so much attention to their hair and their dress, and who
were called Curetes, afforded a pretence for men more warlike
than others, and who passed their lives in arms, to be themselves
called by the same name of Curetes, I mean those in
Eub&#339;a, &AElig;tolia, and Acarnania. Homer also gives this name
to the young soldiers;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;selecting Curetes, the bravest of the Ach&aelig;ans, to carry from the swift
ship, presents, which, yesterday, we promised to Achilles.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_707" id="FNanchor_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_707" class="fnanchor">707</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]<br />[CAS. 467]</a></span></p>

<p>And again;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;Curetes Ach&aelig;i carried the presents.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_708" id="FNanchor_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_708" class="fnanchor">708</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>So much then on the subject of the etymology of the name
Curetes. [The dance in armour is a military dance; this is
shown by the Pyrrhic dance and by Pyrrichus, who, it is said,
invented this kind of exercise for youths, to prepare them for
military service.]<a name="FNanchor_709" id="FNanchor_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_709" class="fnanchor">709</a></p>

<p>9. We are now to consider how the names of these people
agree together, and the theology, which is contained in their
history.</p>

<p>Now this is common both to the Greeks and the Barbarians,
to perform their religious ceremonies with the observance
of a festival, and a relaxation from labour; some are
performed with enthusiasm, others without any emotion;
some accompanied with music, others without music; some in
mysterious privacy, others publicly; and these are the dictates
of nature.<a name="FNanchor_710" id="FNanchor_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_710" class="fnanchor">710</a> For relaxation from labour withdraws the thoughts
from human occupations, and directs the reflecting mind to the
divinity: enthusiasm seems to be attended with a certain divine
inspiration, and to approach the prophetic character;
the mystical concealment of the sacred rites excites veneration
for the divinity, and imitates his nature, which shuns human
senses and perception; music also, accompanied with the
dance, rhythm, and song, for the same reason brings us near
the deity by the pleasure which it excites, and by the charms
of art. For it has been justly said, that men resemble the
gods chiefly in doing good, but it may be said more properly,
when they are happy; and this happiness consists in rejoicing,
in festivals, in philosophy, and in music.<a name="FNanchor_711" id="FNanchor_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_711" class="fnanchor">711</a> For let not
the art be blamed, if it should sometimes be abused by the
musician employing it to excite voluptuousness in convivial
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
meetings at banquets, on the stage, or under other circumstances,
but let the nature of the institutions which are
founded on it be examined.<a name="FNanchor_712" id="FNanchor_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_712" class="fnanchor">712</a></p>

<p>10. Hence Plato, and, before his time, the Pythagoreans,
called music philosophy. They maintained that the world
subsisted by harmony, and considered every kind of music to
be the work of the gods. It is thus that the muses are regarded
as deities, and Apollo has the name of President of
the Muses, and all poetry divine, as being conversant about
the praises of the gods. Thus also they ascribe to music the
formation of manners, as everything which refines the mind
approximates to the power of the gods.</p>

<p>The greater part of the Greeks attribute to Bacchus,
Apollo, Hecate, the Muses, and Ceres, everything connected
with orgies and Bacchanalian rites, dances, and the mysteries
attended upon initiation. They call also Bacchus, Dionysus,
and the chief D&aelig;mon of the mysteries of Ceres.<a name="FNanchor_713" id="FNanchor_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_713" class="fnanchor">713</a> The carrying
about of branches of trees, dances, and initiations are
common to the worship of these gods. But with respect to
Apollo and the Muses, the latter preside over choirs of singers
and dancers; the former presides both over these and divination.
All persons instructed in science, and particularly
those who have cultivated music, are ministers of the Muses;
these and also all who are engaged in divination are ministers
of Apollo. Those of Ceres, are the Myst&aelig;, torch-bearers
and Hierophants; of Dionysus, Seileni, Satyri, Tityri, Bacch&aelig;,
Len&aelig;, Thyi&aelig;, Mimallones, Na&iuml;des, and Nymph&aelig;, as they are
called.</p>

<p>11. But in Crete both these, and the sacred rites of Jupiter
in particular, were celebrated with the performance of orgies,
and by ministers, like the Satyri, who are employed in the worship
of Dionysus. These were called Curetes, certain youths
who executed military movements in armour, accompanied
with dancing, exhibiting the fable of the birth of Jupiter, in
which Saturn was introduced, whose custom it was to devour
his children immediately after their birth; Rhea attempts to
conceal the pains of childbirth, and to remove the new-born
infant out of sight, using her utmost endeavours to preserve it.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]<br />[CAS. 468]</a></span>
In this she has the assistance of the Curetes who surround
the goddess, and by the noise of drums and other similar
sounds, by dancing in armour and by tumult, endeavour to
strike terror into Saturn, and escape notice whilst removing
his child. The child is then delivered into their hands to
be brought up with the same care by which he was rescued.
The Curetes therefore obtained this appellation, either because
they were boys (&#954;&#8057;&#961;&#959;&#953;), or because they educated Jupiter
in his youth (&#954;&#959;&#965;&#961;&#959;&#964;&#961;&#959;&#966;&#949;&#8150;&#957;), for there are two explanations,
inasmuch as they acted the same part with respect to Jupiter
as the Satyri (with respect to Dionysus). Such then is the
worship of the Greeks, as far as relates to the celebration of
orgies.</p>

<p>12. But the Berecyntes, a tribe of Phrygians, the Phrygians
in general, and the Trojans, who live about Mount Ida,
themselves also worship Rhea, and perform orgies in her
honour; they call her mother of gods, Agdistis, and Phrygia,<a name="FNanchor_714" id="FNanchor_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_714" class="fnanchor">714</a>
the Great Goddess; from the places also where she is worshipped,
Id&aelig;a, and Dindymene,<a name="FNanchor_715" id="FNanchor_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_715" class="fnanchor">715</a> Sipylene,<a name="FNanchor_716" id="FNanchor_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_716" class="fnanchor">716</a> Pessinuntis,<a name="FNanchor_717" id="FNanchor_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_717" class="fnanchor">717</a> and
Cybele.<a name="FNanchor_718" id="FNanchor_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_718" class="fnanchor">718</a> The Greeks call her ministers by the same name
Curetes, not that they follow the same mythology, but they
mean a different kind of persons, a sort of agents analogous to
the Satyri. These same ministers are also called by them
Corybantes.</p>

<p>13. We have the testimony of the poets in favour of these
opinions. Pindar, in the Dithyrambus, which begins in this
manner;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;formerly the dithyrambus used to creep upon the ground, long and
trailing.&#8221;</p>

<p>After mentioning the hymns, both ancient and modern, in
honour of Bacchus, he makes a digression, and says,</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;for thee, O Mother, resound the large circles of the cymbals, and the
ringing crotala; for thee, blaze the torches of the yellow pine;&#8221;</p>

<p>where he combines with one another the rites celebrated
among the Greeks in honour of Dionysus with those performed
among the Phrygians in honour of the mother of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
gods. Euripides, in the Bacch&aelig;, does the same thing, conjoining,
from the proximity of the countries,<a name="FNanchor_719" id="FNanchor_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_719" class="fnanchor">719</a> Lydian and
Phrygian customs.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;Then forsaking Tmolus, the rampart of Lydia, my maidens, my pride,
[whom I took from among barbarians and made the partners and companions
of my way, raise on high the tambourine of Phrygia, the tambourine
of the great mother Rhea,] my invention.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;Blest and happy he who, initiated into the sacred rites of the gods,
leads a pure life; who celebrating the orgies of the Great Mother Cybele,
who brandishing on high the thyrsus and with ivy crowned, becomes
Dionysus&#8217; worshipper. Haste, Bacchanalians, haste, and bring Bromius
Dionysus down from the Phrygian mountains to the wide plains of
Greece.&#8221;</p>

<p>And again, in what follows, he combines with these the Cretan
rites.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;Hail, sacred haunt of the Curetes, and divine inhabitants of Crete,
progenitors of Jove, where for me the triple-crested Corybantes in their
caves invented this skin-stretched circle [of the tambourine], who
mingled with Bacchic strains the sweet breath of harmony from Phrygian
pipes, and placed in Rhea&#8217;s hands this instrument which re-echoes to the
joyous shouts of Bacchanalians; from the Mother Rhea the frantic
Satyri succeeded in obtaining it, and introduced it into the dances of the
Trieterides, among whom Dionysus delights to dwell.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_720" id="FNanchor_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_720" class="fnanchor">720</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]<br />[CAS. 479]</a></span></p>

<p>And the chorus in Palamedes says,</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;Not revelling with Dionysus, who together with his mother was cheered
with the resounding drums along the tops of Ida.&#8221;</p>

<p>14. Conjoining then Seilenus, Marsyas, and Olympus, and
ascribing to them the invention of the flute, they thus again
combine Dionysiac and Phrygian rites, frequently confounding
Ida and Olympus,<a name="FNanchor_721" id="FNanchor_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_721" class="fnanchor">721</a> and making them re-echo with their
noise, as if they were the same mountain. There are four
peaks of Ida called Olympi, opposite Antandros.<a name="FNanchor_722" id="FNanchor_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_722" class="fnanchor">722</a> There is
also a Mysian Olympus, bordering upon Ida, but not the same
mountain. Sophocles represents Menelaus in the Polyxena
as setting sail in haste from Troy, and Agamemnon as wishing
to remain behind a short time, with a view to propitiate
Minerva. He introduces Menelaus as saying,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;But do thou remain there on the Id&aelig;an land,</div>
<div class="line">Collect the flocks on Olympus, and offer sacrifice.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_723" id="FNanchor_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_723" class="fnanchor">723</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>15. They invented terms appropriate to the sounds of the
pipe, of the crotala, cymbals, and drums; to the noise also of
shouts; to the cries of Evoe; and to the beating of the ground
with the feet. They invented certain well-known names also
to designate the ministers, dancers, and servants employed
about the sacred rites, as Cabeiri, Corybantes, Pans, Satyri,
Tityri, the god Bacchus; Rhea, Cybele, Cybebe, and Dindymene,
from the places where she was worshipped. [The
god] Sabazius belongs to the Phrygian rites, and may be
considered the child as it were of the [Great] Mother. The
traditional ceremonies observed in his worship are those of
Bacchus.<a name="FNanchor_724" id="FNanchor_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_724" class="fnanchor">724</a></p>

<p>16. The rites called Cotytia, and Bendideia,<a name="FNanchor_725" id="FNanchor_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_725" class="fnanchor">725</a> celebrated
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
among the Thracians, resemble these. The Orphic ceremonies
had their origin among these people. &AElig;schylus mentions the
goddess Cotys, and the instruments used in her worship
among the Edoni.<a name="FNanchor_726" id="FNanchor_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_726" class="fnanchor">726</a> For after saying,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;O divine Cotys, goddess of the Edoni,</div>
<div class="line">With the instruments of the mountain worship;&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>immediately introduces the followers of Dionysus,</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;one holding the bombyces, the admirable work of the turner, with the
fingers makes the loud notes resound, exciting frenzy; another makes
the brass-bound cotyl&aelig; to re-echo.&#8221;</p>

<p>And in another passage;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;The song of victory is poured forth; invisible mimes low and bellow
from time to time like bulls, inspiring fear, and the echo of the drum rolls
along like the noise of subterranean thunder;&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_727" id="FNanchor_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_727" class="fnanchor">727</a></p>

<p>for these are like the Phrygian ceremonies, nor is it at all
improbable that, as the Phrygians themselves are a colony of
Thracians, so they brought from Thrace their sacred ceremonies,
and by joining together Dionysus and the Edonian
Lycurgus they intimate a similarity in the mode of the worship
of both.</p>

<p>17. From the song, the rhythm, and the instruments, all
Thracian music is supposed to be Asiatic. This is evident
also from the places where the Muses are held in honour.
For Pieria, Olympus, Pimpla, and Leibethrum were anciently
places, and mountains, belonging to the Thracians, but at
present they are in the possession of the Macedonians. The
Thracians, who were settled in B&#339;otia, dedicated Helicon to
the Muses, and consecrated the cave of the Nymphs, Leibethriades.
The cultivators of ancient music are said to have
been Thracians, as Orpheus, Mus&aelig;us, Thamyris; hence also
Eumolpus had his name. Those who regard the whole
of Asia as far as India as consecrated to Bacchus, refer to
that country as the origin of a great portion of the present
music. One author speaks of &#8220;striking forcibly the Asiatic
cithara:&#8221; another calls the pipes Berecynthian and Phrygian.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]<br />[CAS. 471]</a></span>
Some of the instruments also have barbarous names,
as Nablas, Sambyce,<a name="FNanchor_728" id="FNanchor_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_728" class="fnanchor">728</a> Barbitus,<a name="FNanchor_729" id="FNanchor_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_729" class="fnanchor">729</a> Magadis,<a name="FNanchor_730" id="FNanchor_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_730" class="fnanchor">730</a> and many others.</p>

<p>18. As in other things the Athenians always showed
their admiration of foreign customs, so they displayed it in
what respected the gods. They adopted many foreign sacred
ceremonies, particularly those of Thrace and Phrygia; for
which they were ridiculed in comedies. Plato mentions the
Bendidean, and Demosthenes the Phrygian rites, where he
is exposing &AElig;schines and his mother to the scorn of the
people; the former for having been present when his mother
was sacrificing, and for frequently joining the band of Bacchanalians
in celebrating their festivals, and shouting, Evo&iuml;,
Sabo&iuml;, Hyes Attes, and Attes Hyes, for these cries belong to
the rites of Sabazius and the Great Mother.</p>

<p>19. But there may be discovered respecting these d&aelig;mons,
and the variety of their names, that they were not called ministers
only of the gods, but themselves were called gods. For
Hesiod says that Hecaterus and the daughter of Phoroneus
had five daughters,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;From whom sprung the goddesses, the mountain nymphs,</div>
<div class="line">And the worthless and idle race of satyrs,</div>
<div class="line">And the gods Curetes, lovers of sport and dance.&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The author of the Phoronis calls the Curetes, players upon
the pipe, and Phrygians; others call them &#8220;earth-born, and
wearing brazen shields.&#8221; Another author terms the Corybantes,
and not the Curetes, Phrygians, and the Curetes, Cretans.
Brazen shields were first worn in Eub&#339;a, whence the
people had the name of Chalcidenses.<a name="FNanchor_731" id="FNanchor_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_731" class="fnanchor">731</a> Others say, that the
Corybantes who came from Bactriana, or, according to some
writers, from the Colchi, were given to Rhea, as a band of armed
ministers, by Titan. But in the Cretan history the Curetes
are called nurses and guardians of Jove, and are described as
having been sent for from Phrygia to Crete by Rhea. According
to other writers, there were nine Telchines in
Rhodes, who accompanied Rhea to Crete, and from nursing<a name="FNanchor_732" id="FNanchor_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_732" class="fnanchor">732</a>
Jupiter had the name of Curetes;<a name="FNanchor_733" id="FNanchor_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_733" class="fnanchor">733</a> that Corybus, one of
their party, was the founder of Hierapytna, and furnished the</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>Prasians<a name="FNanchor_734" id="FNanchor_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_734" class="fnanchor">734</a> in Rhodes with the pretext for saying that Corybantes
were certain d&aelig;mons, children of Minerva and the sun.
By others, the Corybantes are represented to be the children
of Saturn; by others, of Jupiter and Calliope, or to be the
same persons as the Cabeiri; that they went away<a name="FNanchor_735" id="FNanchor_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_735" class="fnanchor">735</a> to Samothrace,<a name="FNanchor_736" id="FNanchor_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_736" class="fnanchor">736</a>
which was formerly called Melite; but their lives
and actions are mysterious.</p>

<p>20. The Scepsian (Demetrius) who has collected fabulous
stories of this kind, does not receive this account because
no mysterious tradition about the Cabeiri is preserved in Samothrace,
yet he gives the opinion of Stesimbrotus of Thasus,
to the effect that the sacred rites in Samothrace were celebrated
in honour of the Cabeiri.<a name="FNanchor_737" id="FNanchor_737"></a><a href="#Footnote_737" class="fnanchor">737</a> Demetrius, however, says that they
had their name from Cabeirus, the mountain in Berecynthia.
According to others, the Curetes were the same as the Corybantes,
and were ministers of Hecate.</p>

<p>The Scepsian says in another place, in contradiction to
Euripides, that it is not the custom in Crete to pay divine
honours to Rhea, and that these rites were not established
there, but in Phrygia only, and in the Troad, and that they
who affirm the contrary are mythologists rather than historians;
and were probably misled by an identity of name, for
Ida is a mountain both in the Troad and in Crete; and
Dicte is a spot in the Scepsian territory, and a mountain in
Crete.<a name="FNanchor_738" id="FNanchor_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_738" class="fnanchor">738</a> Pytna is a peak of Ida, (and a mountain in Crete,)
whence the city Hierapytna has its name. There is Hippocorona
in the territory of Adramyttium, and Hippocoronium<a name="FNanchor_739" id="FNanchor_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_739" class="fnanchor">739</a>
in Crete. Samonium also is the eastern promontory
of the island, and a plain in the Neandris,<a name="FNanchor_740" id="FNanchor_740"></a><a href="#Footnote_740" class="fnanchor">740</a> and in the territory
of the Alexandrians (Alexandria Troas).</p>

<p>21. But Acusilaus, the Argive, mentions a Camillus, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]<br />[CAS. 473]</a></span>
son of Cabeira and Vulcan; who had three sons, Cabeiri,
(and three daughters,) the Nymphs Cabeirides.<a name="FNanchor_741" id="FNanchor_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_741" class="fnanchor">741</a></p>

<p>According to Pherecydes, there sprung from Apollo and
Rhetia nine Corybantes, who lived in Samothrace; that from
Cabeira, the daughter of Proteus and Vulcan, there were
three Cabeiri, and three Nymphs, Cabeirides, and that each
had their own sacred rites. But it was at Lemnos and Imbros
that the Cabeiri were more especially the objects of
divine worship, and in some of the cities of the Troad; their
names are mystical.</p>

<p>Herodotus<a name="FNanchor_742" id="FNanchor_742"></a><a href="#Footnote_742" class="fnanchor">742</a> mentions, that there were at Memphis temples
of the Cabeiri as well as of Vulcan, which were destroyed by
Cambyses. The places where these d&aelig;mons received divine
honours are uninhabited, as Corybantium in the territory
Hamaxitia belonging to the country of the Alexandrians,
near Sminthium;<a name="FNanchor_743" id="FNanchor_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_743" class="fnanchor">743</a> and Corybissa in the Scepsian territory
about the river Eure&iuml;s, and a village of the same name, and
the winter torrent &AElig;thaloe&iuml;s.<a name="FNanchor_744" id="FNanchor_744"></a><a href="#Footnote_744" class="fnanchor">744</a></p>

<p>The Scepsian says, that it is probable that the Curetes and
Corybantes are the same persons, who as youths and boys
were employed to perform the armed dance in the worship of
the mother of the gods. They were called Corybantes<a name="FNanchor_745" id="FNanchor_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_745" class="fnanchor">745</a> from
their dancing gait, and butting with their head (&#954;&#959;&#961;&#8059;&#960;&#964;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#962;);
by the poet they were called &#946;&#951;&#964;&#8049;&#961;&#956;&#959;&#957;&#949;&#962;,</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;Come hither, you who are the best skilled Betarmones among the
Ph&aelig;acians.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_746" id="FNanchor_746"></a><a href="#Footnote_746" class="fnanchor">746</a></p>

<p>Because the Corybantes are dancers, and are frantic, we call
those persons by this name whose movements are furious.</p>

<p>22. Some writers say that the first inhabitants of the
country at the foot of Mount Ida were called Id&aelig;an Dactyli,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
for the country below mountains is called the foot, and
the summits of mountains their heads; so the separate extremities
of Ida (and all are sacred to the mother of the gods)
are called Id&aelig;an Dactyli.<a name="FNanchor_747" id="FNanchor_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_747" class="fnanchor">747</a></p>

<p>But Sophocles<a name="FNanchor_748" id="FNanchor_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_748" class="fnanchor">748</a> supposes, that the first five were males,
who discovered and forged iron,<a name="FNanchor_749" id="FNanchor_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_749" class="fnanchor">749</a> and many other things
which were useful for the purposes of life; that these persons
had five sisters, and from their number had the name of
Dactyli.<a name="FNanchor_750" id="FNanchor_750"></a><a href="#Footnote_750" class="fnanchor">750</a> Different persons however relate these fables differently,
connecting one uncertainty with another. They
differ both with respect to the numbers and the names of
these persons; some of whom they call Celmis, and Damnameneus,
and Hercules, and Acmon, who, according to some
writers, were natives of Ida, according to others, were settlers,
but all agree that they were the first workers in iron, and
upon Mount Ida. All writers suppose them to have been
magicians, attendants upon the mother of the gods, and to have
lived in Phrygia about Mount Ida. They call the Troad
Phrygia, because, after the devastation of Troy, the neighbouring
Phrygians became masters of the country. It is also
supposed that the Curetes and the Corybantes were descendants
of the Id&aelig;an Dactyli, and that they gave the name of
Id&aelig;an Dactyli to the first hundred persons who were born in
Crete; that from these descended nine Curetes, each of whom
had ten children, who were called Id&aelig;an Dactyli.<a name="FNanchor_751" id="FNanchor_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_751" class="fnanchor">751</a></p>

<p>23. Although we are not fond of fabulous stories, yet we
have expatiated upon these, because they belong to subjects of
a theological nature.</p>

<p>All discussion respecting the gods requires an examination
of ancient opinions, and of fables, since the ancients expressed
enigmatically their physical notions concerning the nature of
things, and always intermixed fable with their discoveries.
It is not easy therefore to solve these enigmas exactly, but if
we lay before the reader a multitude of fabulous tales, some
consistent with each other, others which are contradictory, we
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]<br />[CAS. 474]</a></span>
may thus with less difficulty form conjectures about the truth.
For example, mythologists probably represented the ministers
of the gods, and the gods themselves, as coursing over the
mountains, and their enthusiastic behaviour, for the same
reason that they considered the gods to be celestial beings,
and to exercise a providential care over all things, and
especially over signs and presages. Mining, hunting, and a
search after things useful for the purposes of life, appeared to
have a relation to this coursing over the mountains, but juggling
and magic to be connected with enthusiastic behaviour,
religious rites, and divination. Of such a nature, and connected
in particular with the improvement of the arts of life,
were the Dionysiac and Orphic arts. But enough of this subject.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Having</span> described the islands about the Peloponnesus,
and other islands also, some of which are upon, and others in
front of, the Corinthian Gulf, we are next to speak of Crete,<a name="FNanchor_752" id="FNanchor_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_752" class="fnanchor">752</a>
(for it belongs to the Peloponnesus,) and the islands near
Crete, among which are the Cyclades and the Sporades.
Some of these are worthy of notice, others are inconsiderable.</p>

<p>2. At present we are to speak first of Crete.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<p>According to Eudoxus, it is situated in the &AElig;g&aelig;an sea,
but he ought not to have described its situation in that manner,
but have said, that it lies between Cyrenaica and the
part of Greece comprehended between Sunium and Laconia,<a name="FNanchor_753" id="FNanchor_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_753" class="fnanchor">753</a>
extending in length in the direction from west to east, and
parallel to these countries;<a name="FNanchor_754" id="FNanchor_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_754" class="fnanchor">754</a> that it is washed on the north by
the &AElig;g&aelig;an and Cretan seas, and on the south by the African,
which joins the &AElig;gyptian sea.</p>

<p>The western extremity of the island is near Phalasarna;<a name="FNanchor_755" id="FNanchor_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_755" class="fnanchor">755</a>
its breadth is about 200 stadia, and divided into two promontories;
of which the southern is called Criu-Metopon, (or
Ram&#8217;s head,) and that on the north, Cimarus.<a name="FNanchor_756" id="FNanchor_756"></a><a href="#Footnote_756" class="fnanchor">756</a> The eastern
promontory is Samonium,<a name="FNanchor_757" id="FNanchor_757"></a><a href="#Footnote_757" class="fnanchor">757</a> which does not stretch much further
towards the east than Sunium.<a name="FNanchor_758" id="FNanchor_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_758" class="fnanchor">758</a></p>

<p>3. Sosicrates, who, according to Apollodorus, had an exact
knowledge of this island, determines its length (not?)<a name="FNanchor_759" id="FNanchor_759"></a><a href="#Footnote_759" class="fnanchor">759</a> to
exceed 2300 stadia, and its breadth (about 300),<a name="FNanchor_760" id="FNanchor_760"></a><a href="#Footnote_760" class="fnanchor">760</a> so that according
to Sosicrates the circuit of the island is not more than
5000 stadia, but Artemidorus makes it 4100. Hieronymus
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]<br />[CAS. 475]</a></span>
says, that its length is 2000 stadia, and its breadth irregular,
and that the circuit would exceed the number of stadia assigned
by Artemidorus. Throughout one-third of its length,
(beginning from the western parts, the island is of a tolerable
width).<a name="FNanchor_761" id="FNanchor_761"></a><a href="#Footnote_761" class="fnanchor">761</a> Then there is an isthmus of about 100 stadia,
on the northern shore of which is a settlement, called Amphimalla;<a name="FNanchor_762" id="FNanchor_762"></a><a href="#Footnote_762" class="fnanchor">762</a>
on the southern shore is Ph&#339;nix,<a name="FNanchor_763" id="FNanchor_763"></a><a href="#Footnote_763" class="fnanchor">763</a> belonging to the
Lampeis.</p>

<p>The greatest breadth is in the middle of the island.</p>

<p>Here again the shores approach, and form an isthmus
narrower than the former, of about 60 stadia in extent, reckoning
from Minoa,<a name="FNanchor_764" id="FNanchor_764"></a><a href="#Footnote_764" class="fnanchor">764</a> in the district of the Lyctii,<a name="FNanchor_765" id="FNanchor_765"></a><a href="#Footnote_765" class="fnanchor">765</a> to Therapytna,<a name="FNanchor_766" id="FNanchor_766"></a><a href="#Footnote_766" class="fnanchor">766</a>
and the African sea. The city is on the bay. The
shores then terminate in a pointed promontory, the Samonium,
looking towards &AElig;gypt and the islands of the Rhodians.<a name="FNanchor_767" id="FNanchor_767"></a><a href="#Footnote_767" class="fnanchor">767</a></p>

<p>4. The island is mountainous and woody, but has fertile
valleys.</p>

<p>The mountains towards the west are called Leuca, or the
White Mountains,<a name="FNanchor_768" id="FNanchor_768"></a><a href="#Footnote_768" class="fnanchor">768</a> not inferior in height to the Ta&yuml;getum,<a name="FNanchor_769" id="FNanchor_769"></a><a href="#Footnote_769" class="fnanchor">769</a>
and extending in length about 300 stadia. They form a
ridge, which terminates at the narrow parts (the isthmus).
In the middle of the island, in the widest part, is (Ida),<a name="FNanchor_770" id="FNanchor_770"></a><a href="#Footnote_770" class="fnanchor">770</a> the
highest of the mountains there. Its compass is about 600
stadia. It is surrounded by the principal cities. There are
other mountains equal in height to the White Mountains, some
of which terminate on the south, others towards the east.</p>

<p>5. From the Cyren&aelig;an<a name="FNanchor_771" id="FNanchor_771"></a><a href="#Footnote_771" class="fnanchor">771</a> territory to Criu-metopon<a name="FNanchor_772" id="FNanchor_772"></a><a href="#Footnote_772" class="fnanchor">772</a> is a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
voyage of two days and nights. From Cimarus [to Malea]
are 700 stadia.<a name="FNanchor_773" id="FNanchor_773"></a><a href="#Footnote_773" class="fnanchor">773</a> In the midway is Cythera.<a name="FNanchor_774" id="FNanchor_774"></a><a href="#Footnote_774" class="fnanchor">774</a> From the promontory
Samonium<a name="FNanchor_775" id="FNanchor_775"></a><a href="#Footnote_775" class="fnanchor">775</a> to &AElig;gypt a ship sails in four days and
nights, but, according to other writers, in three. Some say
that it is a voyage of 5000 stadia; others, of still less than
this. According to Eratosthenes, the distance from Cyrena&iuml;ca
to Criu-Metopon is 2000 stadia, and thence to Peloponnesus
less than [1000].<a name="FNanchor_776" id="FNanchor_776"></a><a href="#Footnote_776" class="fnanchor">776</a></p>

<p>6. One language is intermixed with another, says the poet;
there are in Crete,</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;Ach&aelig;i, the brave Eteocretans, Cydones, Dorians divided into three
bands,<a name="FNanchor_777" id="FNanchor_777"></a><a href="#Footnote_777" class="fnanchor">777</a> and the divine Pelasgi.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_778" id="FNanchor_778"></a><a href="#Footnote_778" class="fnanchor">778</a></p>

<p>Of these people, says Staphylus, the Dorians occupy the
eastern parts of the island, Cydonians the western, Eteocretans
the southern, to whom Prasus, a small town, belonged, where
is the temple of the Dict&aelig;an Jupiter; the other nations, being
more powerful, inhabited the plains. It is probable that the
Eteocretans<a name="FNanchor_779" id="FNanchor_779"></a><a href="#Footnote_779" class="fnanchor">779</a> and Cydonians were aboriginal inhabitants, and
that the others were foreigners, who Andron says came from
Thessaly, formerly called Doris, but now Hesti&aelig;otis, from
which country he says the Dorians, who were settled about
Parnassus, migrated, and founded Erineum, B&#339;um, and Cytinium,
whence they are called by the poet Tricha&iuml;ces, or tripartite.
But the account of Andron is not generally admitted,
who represents the Tetrapolis Doris as composed of three
cities, and the metropolis of the Dorians as a colony of Thessalians.
The epithet Tricha&iuml;ces<a name="FNanchor_780" id="FNanchor_780"></a><a href="#Footnote_780" class="fnanchor">780</a> is understood to be derived
either from their wearing a triple crest,<a name="FNanchor_781" id="FNanchor_781"></a><a href="#Footnote_781" class="fnanchor">781</a> or from having crests
of hair.<a name="FNanchor_782" id="FNanchor_782"></a><a href="#Footnote_782" class="fnanchor">782</a></p>

<p>7. There are many cities in Crete, but the largest and
most distinguished are Cnossus,<a name="FNanchor_783" id="FNanchor_783"></a><a href="#Footnote_783" class="fnanchor">783</a> Gortyna,<a name="FNanchor_784" id="FNanchor_784"></a><a href="#Footnote_784" class="fnanchor">784</a> Cydonia.<a name="FNanchor_785" id="FNanchor_785"></a><a href="#Footnote_785" class="fnanchor">785</a> Both
Homer and later writers celebrate Cnossus(11) above the rest,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]<br />[CAS. 476]</a></span>
calling it vast, and the palace of Minos. It maintained its
pre-eminence for a long period. It afterwards lost its ascendency,
and was deprived of many of its customs and privileges.
The superiority was transferred to Gortyna and Lyctus.<a name="FNanchor_786" id="FNanchor_786"></a><a href="#Footnote_786" class="fnanchor">786</a>
But it afterwards recovered its ancient rank of the
capital city. Cnossus lies in a plain, with its ancient circumference
of 30 stadia, between the Lyctian and Gortynian
territory; [distant] 200 stadia from Gortyna, and from Lyttus
120, which the poet<a name="FNanchor_787" id="FNanchor_787"></a><a href="#Footnote_787" class="fnanchor">787</a> calls Lyctus. Cnossus is at the distance
of 25 stadia from the northern sea; Gortyna 90, and
Lyctus 80, stadia from the African sea. Cnossus has a marine
arsenal, Heracleium.<a name="FNanchor_788" id="FNanchor_788"></a><a href="#Footnote_788" class="fnanchor">788</a></p>

<p>8. Minos, it is said, used as an arsenal Amnisus,<a name="FNanchor_789" id="FNanchor_789"></a><a href="#Footnote_789" class="fnanchor">789</a> where is
a temple of Eileithyia. Cnossus formerly had the name of
C&aelig;ratus, which is the name of the river<a name="FNanchor_790" id="FNanchor_790"></a><a href="#Footnote_790" class="fnanchor">790</a> which runs beside it.</p>

<p>Minos<a name="FNanchor_791" id="FNanchor_791"></a><a href="#Footnote_791" class="fnanchor">791</a> is regarded as an excellent legislator, and the first
who possessed the sovereignty of the sea. He divided the
island into three portions, in each of which he built a city;
Cnossus * * * * * * *,<a name="FNanchor_792" id="FNanchor_792"></a><a href="#Footnote_792" class="fnanchor">792</a> opposite to Peloponnesus, which
lies toward the north.</p>

<p>According to Ephorus, Minos was an imitator of Rhadamanthus,
an ancient personage, and a most just man. He had
the same name as his brother, who appears to have been the
first to civilize the island by laws and institutions, by founding
cities, and by establishing forms of government. He pretended
to receive from Jupiter the decrees which he promulgated.
It was probably in imitation of Rhadamanthus that
Minos went up to the cave of Jupiter, at intervals of nine
years, and brought from thence a set of ordinances, which he
said were the commands of Jove; for which reason the poet
thus expresses himself;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;There reigned Minos, who every ninth year conversed with the great
Jupiter.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_793" id="FNanchor_793"></a><a href="#Footnote_793" class="fnanchor">793</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p>Such is the statement of Ephorus; the ancients on the other
hand give a different account, and say that he was tyrannical
and violent, and an exactor of tribute, and speak in the strain
of tragedy about the Minotaur, the Labyrinth, and the adventures
of Theseus and D&aelig;dalus.</p>

<p>9. It is difficult to determine which is right. There is
another story also not generally received; some persons affirming
that Minos was a foreigner, others that he was a
native of the island. Homer seems to support the latter
opinion, when he says, that</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;Minos, the guardian of Crete, was the first offspring of Jupiter.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_794" id="FNanchor_794"></a><a href="#Footnote_794" class="fnanchor">794</a></p>

<p>It is generally admitted with regard to Crete that in ancient
times it was governed by good laws, and induced the
wisest of the Greeks to imitate its form of government, and
particularly the Laced&aelig;monians, as Plato shows in his &#8220;Laws,&#8221;
and Ephorus has described in his work &#8220;Europe.&#8221; Afterwards
there was a change in the government, and for the
most part for the worse. For the Tyrrheni, who chiefly infested
our sea, were followed by the Cretans, who succeeded
to the haunts and piratical practices of the former people, and
these again afterwards were subject to the devastations of
the Cilicians. But the Romans destroyed them all after the
conquest of Crete,<a name="FNanchor_795" id="FNanchor_795"></a><a href="#Footnote_795" class="fnanchor">795</a> and demolished the piratical strongholds
of the Cilicians. At present Cnossus has even a colony of
Romans.</p>

<p>10. So much then respecting Cnossus, a city to which I
am no stranger; but owing to the condition of human affairs,
their vicissitudes and accidents, the connexion and intercourse
that subsisted between ourselves and the city is at an
end. Which may be thus explained. Doryla&uuml;s, a military
tactician, a friend of Mithridates Euergetes, was appointed,
on account of his experience in military affairs, to levy a body
of foreigners, and was frequently in Greece and Thrace, and
often in the company of persons who came from Crete, before
the Romans were in possession of the island. A great multitude
of mercenary soldiers was collected there, from whom
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]<br />[CAS. 478]</a></span>
even the bands of pirates were recruited. During the stay
of Doryla&uuml;s in the island, a war happened to break out between
the Cnossians and the Gortynians. He was appointed
general by the Cnossians, and having finished the war speedily
and successfully, he obtained the highest honours. A
short time afterwards, being informed that Euergetes had been
treacherously put to death by his courtiers at Sinope, and
that he was succeeded in the government by his wife and
children, he abandoned everything there, remained at Cnossus,
and married a Macedonian woman of the name of Sterope,
by whom he had two sons, Lagetas and Stratarchas,
(the latter I myself saw when in extreme old age,) and one
daughter. Of the two sons of Euergetes, he who was surnamed
Eupator succeeded to the throne when he was eleven
years of age; Doryla&uuml;s, the son of Philet&aelig;rus, was his foster-brother.
Philet&aelig;rus was the brother of Doryla&uuml;s the Tactician.
The king had been so much pleased with his intimacy
with Doryla&uuml;s when they lived together as children, that on
attaining manhood he not only promoted Doryla&uuml;s to the highest
honours, but extended his regard to his relations and
sent for them from Cnossus. At this time Lagetas and his
brother had lost their father, and were themselves grown up
to manhood. They quitted Cnossus, and came to Mithridates.
My mother&#8217;s mother was the daughter of Lagetas. While
he enjoyed prosperity, they also prospered; but upon his
downfall (for he was detected in attempting to transfer the
kingdom to the Romans with a view to his own appointment
to the sovereignty) the affairs of Cnossus were involved in his
ruin and disgrace; and all intercourse with the Cnossians,
who themselves had experienced innumerable vicissitudes of
fortune, was suspended.</p>

<p>So much then respecting Cnossus.</p>

<p>11. After Cnossus, the city Gortyna seems to have held
the second place in rank and power. For when these cities
acted in concert they held in subjection all the rest of the inhabitants,
and when they were at variance there was discord
throughout the island; and whichever party Cydonia espoused,
to them she was a most important accession.</p>

<p>The city of the Gortynians lies in a plain, and was perhaps
anciently protected by a wall, as Homer also intimates,</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>

&#8220;and Gortyna, a walled city;&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_796" id="FNanchor_796"></a><a href="#Footnote_796" class="fnanchor">796</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>it lost afterwards its walls, which were destroyed from their
foundation, and it has remained ever since without walls; for
Ptolemy Philopator, who began to build a wall, proceeded with
it to the distance only of about 8 stadia. Formerly the building
occupied a considerable compass, extending nearly 50 stadia.
It is distant from the African sea, and from Leben its mart,
90 stadia. It has also another arsenal, Matalum.<a name="FNanchor_797" id="FNanchor_797"></a><a href="#Footnote_797" class="fnanchor">797</a> It is distant
from that 130 stadia. The river Leth&aelig;us<a name="FNanchor_798" id="FNanchor_798"></a><a href="#Footnote_798" class="fnanchor">798</a> flows through
the whole of the city.</p>

<p>12. Leucocomas and Euxynthetus his erastes (or lover),
whom Theophrastus mentions in his discourse on Love, were
natives of Leben.<a name="FNanchor_799" id="FNanchor_799"></a><a href="#Footnote_799" class="fnanchor">799</a> One of the tasks enjoined Euxynthetus
by Leucocomas was this, according to Theophrastus, to
bring him his dog from Prasus.<a name="FNanchor_800" id="FNanchor_800"></a><a href="#Footnote_800" class="fnanchor">800</a> The Prasii border upon
the Lebenii at the distance of 60 stadia from the sea, and
from Gortyn 180. We have said that Prasus was subject to
the Eteocretans, and that the temple of the Dict&aelig;an Jupiter
was there. For Dicte<a name="FNanchor_801" id="FNanchor_801"></a><a href="#Footnote_801" class="fnanchor">801</a> is near; not, as Aratus<a name="FNanchor_802" id="FNanchor_802"></a><a href="#Footnote_802" class="fnanchor">802</a> alleges, near
Ida; since Dicte is distant 1000 stadia from Mount Ida, and
situated at that distance from it towards the rising sun; and
100 stadia from the promontory Samonium. Prasus was
situated between the promontory Samonium, and the Cherrhonesus,
at the distance of 60 stadia from the sea. It was razed
by the Hierapytnii. He says, too, that Callimachus<a name="FNanchor_803" id="FNanchor_803"></a><a href="#Footnote_803" class="fnanchor">803</a> is not
right in asserting that Britomartis, in her escape from the
violence offered by Minos, leaped from Dicte among the nets
of the fishermen (&#948;&#8055;&#954;&#964;&#965;&#945;), and that hence she had the name of
Dictynna from the Cydoniat&aelig;, and the mountain that of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]<br />[CAS. 479]</a></span>
Dicte. For Cydonia is not at all situated in the neighbourhood
of these places, but lies at the western extremity of the
island. The mountain Tityrus<a name="FNanchor_804" id="FNanchor_804"></a><a href="#Footnote_804" class="fnanchor">804</a> belongs to the Cydonian territory;
upon it is situated a temple, not called Dict&aelig;an, but
Dictynn&aelig;an.</p>

<p>13. Cydonia is situated on the sea, fronting Laconia, at an
equal distance from both Cnossus and Gortyn, about 800
stadia, and from Aptera 80, and from the sea in this quarter
40 stadia. Cisamus<a name="FNanchor_805" id="FNanchor_805"></a><a href="#Footnote_805" class="fnanchor">805</a> is the naval arsenal of Aptera.<a name="FNanchor_806" id="FNanchor_806"></a><a href="#Footnote_806" class="fnanchor">806</a> The
Polyrrhenii border upon the Cydoniat&aelig; towards the west; in
their territory is the temple of Dictynna. They are at the
distance of about 30 stadia from the sea, and 60 from Phalasarna.
Formerly they lived in villages; then Ach&aelig;ans and
Laconians settled there together, and fortified with a wall a
strong site fronting the south.</p>

<p>14. Of the three cities founded by Minos, the last, which
was Ph&aelig;stus,<a name="FNanchor_807" id="FNanchor_807"></a><a href="#Footnote_807" class="fnanchor">807</a> was razed by the Gortynians; it was at the
distance of 60 stadia from Gortyn, 20 from the sea, and from
Matalum, the arsenal, 40 stadia. They who razed the city
possess the territory. Rhytium also together with Ph&aelig;stus
belongs to the Gortynians,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;both Ph&aelig;stus and Rhytium.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_808" id="FNanchor_808"></a><a href="#Footnote_808" class="fnanchor">808</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Epimenides, who performed lustrations by the means of his
poetry, is said to have been a native of Ph&aelig;stus. Olyssa
(Lisses?) also belonged to the territory of Ph&aelig;stus.</p>

<p>Cherrhonesus,<a name="FNanchor_809" id="FNanchor_809"></a><a href="#Footnote_809" class="fnanchor">809</a> as it is called, is the arsenal of Lyttus or
(Lyctus), which we have before mentioned; on the former is
the temple of Britomartis.</p>

<p>Miletus and Lycastus, the cities which were enumerated
together with Lyctus, no longer exist; but the territory, after
they had razed the city (Lyctus), was partitioned among
Lyctians and Cnossians.</p>

<p>15. As the poet in one place speaks of Crete as having a
hundred, and in another ninety, cities, Ephorus says, that ten
were founded in later times after the Trojan war by the Dorians,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
who accompanied Alth&aelig;menes the Argive, and that
hence Ulysses speaks of its ninety cities. This account is
probable. But others say, that the ten were razed by the
enemies of Idomeneus; but the poet does not say that Crete
had a hundred cities at the time of the Trojan war, but in his
own age, for he speaks in his own person; but if the words
had been those of some person then living, as those in the
Odyssey, where Ulysses says, Crete had ninety cities, they
might have been properly understood in this manner. But
even if we admit this, the subsequent verses will not be exempt
from objection. For neither at the time of the expedition,
nor after the return of Idomeneus, is it probable that
these cities were destroyed by his enemies, for the poet says,</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;but Idomeneus brought back all his companions who had survived the
war to Crete; the sea had not deprived him of any of them;&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_810" id="FNanchor_810"></a><a href="#Footnote_810" class="fnanchor">810</a></p>

<p>for he would have mentioned such a misfortune. Ulysses indeed
might not have been acquainted with the destruction of
these cities, for he had not had any intercourse with any of the
Greeks either during or after his wanderings; but (Nestor),
who had been the companion of Idomeneus in the expedition
and in his escape from shipwreck, could not be ignorant of
what had happened at home during the expedition and before
his return. But he must certainly have been aware of what
occurred after his return. For if he and all his companions
escaped, he returned so powerful that their enemies were not
in a position to deprive them of ten cities.</p>

<p>Such then is the general description of the country of Crete.</p>

<p>16. With respect to the form of government, which Ephorus
has described at large, it will be sufficient to give a cursory
account of the principal parts. The law-giver, says
Ephorus, seems to lay, as the foundation of his constitution,
the greatest good that states can enjoy, namely, liberty; for it
is this alone which makes the property of every kind which
a man possesses his own; in a state of slavery it belongs to
the governor, and not to the governed. The liberty also
which men enjoy must be guarded. Unanimity ensues, when
the dissensions that arise from covetousness and luxury<a name="FNanchor_811" id="FNanchor_811"></a><a href="#Footnote_811" class="fnanchor">811</a> are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]<br />[CAS. 481]</a></span>
removed. Now where all live temperately and frugally, neither
envy, nor injuries, nor hatred have place among equals.
Whence the young were enjoined to repair to the Agel&aelig;, and
those of mature age to assemble at the Syssitia, or common
meals, called Andreia, in order that the poorer sort, who were
fed at the public charge, might partake of the same fare as
the rich.</p>

<p>With a view that courage, and not fear, should predominate,
they were accustomed from childhood to the use of arms, and
to endure fatigue. Hence they disregarded heat and cold,
rugged and steep roads, blows received in gymnastic exercises
and in set battles.</p>

<p>They practised archery, and the dance in armour, which
the Curetes first invented, and was afterwards perfected by
Pyrrhichus, and called after him Pyrrhiche. Hence even their
sports were not without their use in their training for war.
With the same intention they used the Cretan measures in
their songs; the tones of these measures are extremely loud;
they were invented by Thales, to whom are ascribed the
p&aelig;ans and other native songs and many of their usages.
They adopted a military dress also, and shoes, and considered
armour as the most valuable of all presents.</p>

<p>17. Some, he says, alleged that many of the institutions
supposed to be Cretan were of Laced&aelig;monian origin; but the
truth is, they were invented by the former, but perfected by the
Spartans. The Cretans, when their cities, and particularly
Cnossus, were ravaged, neglected military affairs, but some
usages were more observed by the Lyttii and Gortynii, and
some other small cities, than by the Cnossians. Those persons,
who maintain the priority of the Laconian institutions,
adduce as evidence of this those of the Lyttii, because as colonists
they would retain the customs of the parent state. Otherwise,
it would be absurd for those, who lived under a better
form of constitution and government, to be imitators of a
worse. But this is not correct. For we ought not to form
conjectures respecting the ancient from the present state of
things, for each has undergone contrary changes. The Cretans
were formerly powerful at sea, so that it was a proverbial
saying addressed to those who pretended to be ignorant
of what they knew, &#8220;a Cretan, and not know the sea;&#8221;
but at present they have abandoned nautical affairs.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<p>Nor did it follow necessarily that, because there were some
cities in Crete colonized by Spartans, they should continue
to observe Spartan usages, since many of the cities of colonists
do not preserve the customs of the mother country; and there
are many cities in Crete, the inhabitants of which are not
colonists, and yet have the same usages as those that have received
colonies.</p>

<p>18. Lycurgus, the Spartan legislator, he says, was five
generations later than Alth&aelig;menes, who conducted the colony
into Crete. He is said by historians to have been the son of
Cissus, who founded Argos<a name="FNanchor_812" id="FNanchor_812"></a><a href="#Footnote_812" class="fnanchor">812</a> about the same time that Procles
was engaged in establishing a colony at Sparta. It is also
generally admitted that Lycurgus was the sixth in descent
from Procles.<a name="FNanchor_813" id="FNanchor_813"></a><a href="#Footnote_813" class="fnanchor">813</a> Copies do not precede the models, nor modern
precede ancient things. The usual kind of dancing
practised among the Laced&aelig;monians, the measures, and the
p&aelig;ans sung according to a certain mood, and many other
usages, are called among them Cretan, as if they came from
Crete. But among the ancient customs, those relative to the
administration of the state have the same designations as in
Crete,<a name="FNanchor_814" id="FNanchor_814"></a><a href="#Footnote_814" class="fnanchor">814</a> as the council of Gerontes<a name="FNanchor_815" id="FNanchor_815"></a><a href="#Footnote_815" class="fnanchor">815</a> and that of the Knights,<a name="FNanchor_816" id="FNanchor_816"></a><a href="#Footnote_816" class="fnanchor">816</a>
except that in Crete the knights had horses; whence it is
conjectured, that the council of Knights in Crete is more
ancient, since the origin of the appellation is preserved. But
the Spartan knight did not keep a horse. They who perform
the same functions as the Cosmi in Crete, have the different
title of Ephori [in Sparta]. The Syssitia, or common
meal, is even at present called Andreia among the Cretans;
but among the Spartans they did not continue to call it by its
former name, as it is found in the poet Alcman;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;In festivals and in joyous assemblies of the Andreia, it is fit to begin
the p&aelig;an in honour of the guests.&#8221;</p>

<p>19. The occasion of the journey of Lycurgus to Crete is
said by the inhabitants to be as follows. The elder brother
of Lycurgus was Polydectes, who, at his death, left his wife
pregnant. Lycurgus reigned in place of his brother till the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]<br />[CAS. 483]</a></span>
birth of a son. He then became the guardian of the child,
who was heir to the kingdom. Some one said to him insultingly,
he was sure Lycurgus would be king. Suspecting
that by this speech he might be accused of contriving a plot
against the child, and fearing that, if the child should die by
any accident, his enemies might impute its death to him, he
departed to Crete. This is said to have been the cause of his
journey. Upon his arrival in Crete he became acquainted with
Thales, the lyric poet and legislator. He learnt from this person
the plan adopted by Rhadamanthus in former times, and
afterwards by Minos in promulgating their laws, so as to procure
a belief that they proceeded from Jupiter. He was also
in &AElig;gypt, and obtained information respecting the laws and
customs of that country.<a name="FNanchor_817" id="FNanchor_817"></a><a href="#Footnote_817" class="fnanchor">817</a> According to some writers, he met
at Chios with Homer, who was living there, and then returned
to his own country, where he found Charilaus, the son
of his brother Polydectes, upon the throne. He then began to
frame laws, repairing to the god at Delphi, and bringing thence
ordinances, as Minos brought his from the cave of Jupiter.<a name="FNanchor_818" id="FNanchor_818"></a><a href="#Footnote_818" class="fnanchor">818</a>
The greater part of these ordinances were similar to those of
Minos.</p>

<p>20. The following are the principal of the laws of Crete,
which Ephorus has given in detail.</p>

<p>All the Cretans, who are selected at the same time from
the troop (&#7936;&#947;&#8051;&#955;&#951;) of youths, are compelled to marry at once.
They do not however take the young women whom they
have married immediately to their homes, until they are qualified
to administer household affairs.</p>

<p>The woman&#8217;s dower, if she has brothers, is half of the brother&#8217;s
portion.</p>

<p>The children are taught to read, to chaunt songs taken
from the laws, and some kinds of music.</p>

<p>While they are still very young they are taken to the Syssitia,
called Andreia. They sit on the ground, eating their food
together, dressed in mean garments, which are not changed
in winter or summer. They wait upon themselves and on the
men. Both those of the same and those of different messes
have battles with one another. A trainer of boys presides
over each Andreion. As they grow older they are formed into
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
(&#7944;&#947;&#8051;&#955;&#945;&#953;) or troops of youths. The most illustrious and powerful
of the youths form Agel&aelig;, each individual assembling together
as many as he can collect. The governor of the troop
is generally the father of the youth who has assembled them
together, and has the power of taking them to hunt and to
exercise themselves in running, and of punishing the disobedient.
They are maintained at the public charge.</p>

<p>On certain set days troop encounters troop, marching in
time to the sound of the pipe and lyre, as is their custom in
actual war. They inflict blows, some with the hand, and
some even with iron weapons.</p>

<p>21. They have a peculiar custom with respect to their attachments.
They do not influence the objects of their love
by persuasion, but have recourse to violent abduction. The
lover apprizes the friends of the youth, three or more days
beforehand, of his intention to carry off the object of his affection.
It is reckoned a most base act to conceal the youth, or
not to permit him to walk about as usual, since it would be
an acknowledgment that the youth was unworthy of such a
lover. But if they are informed that the ravisher is equal or
superior in rank, or other circumstances, to the youth, they
pursue and oppose the former slightly, merely in conformity
with the custom. They then willingly allow him to carry off
the youth. If however he is an unworthy person, they take
the youth from him. This show of resistance does not end,
till the youth is received into the Andreium to which the
ravisher belongs. They do not regard as an object of affection
a youth exceedingly handsome, but him who is distinguished
for courage and modesty. The lover makes the youth
presents, and takes him away to whatever place he likes.
The persons present at the abduction accompany them, and
having passed two months in feasting, and in the chase, (for
it is not permitted to detain the youth longer,) they return to
the city. The youth is dismissed with presents, which consist
of a military dress, an ox, and a drinking cup; the last
are prescribed by law, and besides these many other very
costly gifts, so that the friends contribute each their share in
order to diminish the expense.</p>

<p>The youth sacrifices the ox to Jupiter, and entertains at a
feast those who came down with him from the mountains.
He then declares concerning the intercourse with the lover,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]<br />[CAS. 484]</a></span>
whether it took place with his consent or not, since the law
allows him, if any violence is used in the abduction, to insist
upon redress, and set him free from his engagement with the
lover. But for the beautiful and high-born not to have
lovers is disgraceful, since this neglect would be attributed to
a bad disposition.</p>

<p>The parastathentes, for this is the name which they give
to those youths who have been carried away, enjoy certain
honours. At races and at festivals they have the principal
places. They are permitted to wear the stole, which distinguishes
them from other persons, and which has been presented
to them by their lovers; and not only at that time, but
in mature age, they appear in a distinctive dress, by which
each individual is recognised as Kleinos, for this name is
given to the object of their attachment, and that of Philetor
to the lover.</p>

<p>These then are the usages respecting attachments.</p>

<p>22. They elect ten Archons. On matters of highest moment
they have recourse to the counsel of the Gerontes, as
they are called. They admit into this council those who
have been thought worthy of the office of Cosmi, and who
were otherwise persons of tried worth.</p>

<p>I considered the form of government among the Cretans as
worthy of description, on account both of its peculiarity and
its fame. Few of these institutions are now in existence, and
the administration of affairs is chiefly conducted according to
the orders of the Romans, as is the case also in their other
provinces.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">The</span> islands about Crete are Thera,<a name="FNanchor_819" id="FNanchor_819"></a><a href="#Footnote_819" class="fnanchor">819</a> the capital of the
Cyren&aelig;ans, and a colony of the Laced&aelig;monians; and near
Thera is Anaphe,<a name="FNanchor_820" id="FNanchor_820"></a><a href="#Footnote_820" class="fnanchor">820</a> in which is the temple of Apollo &AElig;gletes.
Callimachus speaks of it in one place, thus,</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

&#8220;And &AElig;glete Anaphe, close to the Laced&aelig;monian Thera;&#8221;</div>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;Mother of my country, celebrated for its fine breed of horses.&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Thera is a long island, about 200 stadia in circumference. It
lies opposite to the island Dia,<a name="FNanchor_821" id="FNanchor_821"></a><a href="#Footnote_821" class="fnanchor">821</a> towards the Cnossian Heracleium.
It is distant about 700 stadia from Crete. Near it
are Anaphe and Therasia.<a name="FNanchor_822" id="FNanchor_822"></a><a href="#Footnote_822" class="fnanchor">822</a> The little island Ios<a name="FNanchor_823" id="FNanchor_823"></a><a href="#Footnote_823" class="fnanchor">823</a> is distant
from the latter about 100 stadia. Here according to some
authors the poet Homer was buried.<a name="FNanchor_824" id="FNanchor_824"></a><a href="#Footnote_824" class="fnanchor">824</a> In going from Ios towards
the west are Sicenus<a name="FNanchor_825" id="FNanchor_825"></a><a href="#Footnote_825" class="fnanchor">825</a> and Lagusa,<a name="FNanchor_826" id="FNanchor_826"></a><a href="#Footnote_826" class="fnanchor">826</a> and Pholegandrus,<a name="FNanchor_827" id="FNanchor_827"></a><a href="#Footnote_827" class="fnanchor">827</a>
which Aratus calls the iron island, on account of its rocks.
Near these islands is Cimolus,<a name="FNanchor_828" id="FNanchor_828"></a><a href="#Footnote_828" class="fnanchor">828</a> whence is obtained the Cimolian
earth. From Cimolus Siphnus<a name="FNanchor_829" id="FNanchor_829"></a><a href="#Footnote_829" class="fnanchor">829</a> is visible. To this
island is applied the proverb, &#8220;a Siphnian bone (astragalus),&#8221;
on account of its insignificance. Still nearer, both to Cimolus
and Crete, is Melos,<a name="FNanchor_830" id="FNanchor_830"></a><a href="#Footnote_830" class="fnanchor">830</a> more considerable than these. It is
distant from the Hermionic promontory, the Scyll&aelig;um,<a name="FNanchor_831" id="FNanchor_831"></a><a href="#Footnote_831" class="fnanchor">831</a> 700
stadia, and nearly as many from the Dictynn&aelig;an promontory.
The Athenians formerly despatched an army to Melos,<a name="FNanchor_832" id="FNanchor_832"></a><a href="#Footnote_832" class="fnanchor">832</a> and
put to death the inhabitants from youth upwards.</p>

<p>These islands are situated in the Cretan sea. Delos,<a name="FNanchor_833" id="FNanchor_833"></a><a href="#Footnote_833" class="fnanchor">833</a> the
Cyclades about it, and the Sporades adjacent to these, belong
rather to the &AElig;g&aelig;an sea. To the Sporades also are to be referred
the islands about Crete, which I have already mentioned.</p>

<p>2. The city of Delos is in a plain. Delos contains the temple
of Apollo, and the Latoum, or temple of Latona. The
Cynthus,<a name="FNanchor_834" id="FNanchor_834"></a><a href="#Footnote_834" class="fnanchor">834</a> a naked and rugged mountain, overhangs the city.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]<br />[CAS. 485]</a></span>
The Inopus,<a name="FNanchor_835" id="FNanchor_835"></a><a href="#Footnote_835" class="fnanchor">835</a> not a large river, for the island is small, flows
through it. Anciently, even from the heroic times, this
island has been held in veneration on account of the divinities
worshipped here. Here, according to the fable, Latona was
relieved from the pains of labour, and gave birth to Apollo
and Diana.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;Before this time,&#8221; (says Pindar,<a name="FNanchor_836" id="FNanchor_836"></a><a href="#Footnote_836" class="fnanchor">836</a>) &#8220;Delos was carried about by the
waves, and by winds blowing from every quarter, but when the daughter
of C&#339;us set her foot upon it, who was then suffering the sharp pangs of
approaching childbirth, at that instant four upright columns, resting on
adamant, sprang from the depths of the earth and retained it fast on the
rugged rock; there she brought forth, and beheld her happy offspring.&#8221;</p>

<p>The islands lying about it, called Cyclades, gave it celebrity,
since they were in the habit of sending at the public charge,
as a testimony of respect, sacred delegates, (Theori,) sacrifices,
and bands of virgins; they also repaired thither in great
multitudes to celebrate festivals.<a name="FNanchor_837" id="FNanchor_837"></a><a href="#Footnote_837" class="fnanchor">837</a></p>

<p>3. Originally, there were said to be twelve Cyclades, but
many others were added to them. Artemidorus enumerates
(fifteen?) where he is speaking of the island Helena,<a name="FNanchor_838" id="FNanchor_838"></a><a href="#Footnote_838" class="fnanchor">838</a> and
of which he says that it extends from Thoricus<a name="FNanchor_839" id="FNanchor_839"></a><a href="#Footnote_839" class="fnanchor">839</a> to Sunium,<a name="FNanchor_840" id="FNanchor_840"></a><a href="#Footnote_840" class="fnanchor">840</a>
and is about 60 stadia in length; it is from this island, he
says, the Cyclades, as they are called, begin. He names
Ceos,<a name="FNanchor_841" id="FNanchor_841"></a><a href="#Footnote_841" class="fnanchor">841</a> as the nearest island to Helena, and next to this Cythnus,
Seriphus,<a name="FNanchor_842" id="FNanchor_842"></a><a href="#Footnote_842" class="fnanchor">842</a> Melos, Siphnus, Cimolus, Prepesinthus,<a name="FNanchor_843" id="FNanchor_843"></a><a href="#Footnote_843" class="fnanchor">843</a> Oliarus,<a name="FNanchor_844" id="FNanchor_844"></a><a href="#Footnote_844" class="fnanchor">844</a>
and besides these Paros,<a name="FNanchor_845" id="FNanchor_845"></a><a href="#Footnote_845" class="fnanchor">845</a> Naxos,<a name="FNanchor_846" id="FNanchor_846"></a><a href="#Footnote_846" class="fnanchor">846</a> Syros,<a name="FNanchor_847" id="FNanchor_847"></a><a href="#Footnote_847" class="fnanchor">847</a> Myconus,<a name="FNanchor_848" id="FNanchor_848"></a><a href="#Footnote_848" class="fnanchor">848</a>
Tenos,<a name="FNanchor_849" id="FNanchor_849"></a><a href="#Footnote_849" class="fnanchor">849</a> Andros,<a name="FNanchor_850" id="FNanchor_850"></a><a href="#Footnote_850" class="fnanchor">850</a> Gyarus.<a name="FNanchor_851" id="FNanchor_851"></a><a href="#Footnote_851" class="fnanchor">851</a> The rest I consider as belonging
to the Twelve, but not Prepesinthus, Oliarus, and Gyarus.
When I put in at the latter island I found a small village inhabited
by fishermen. When we left it we took in a fisherman,
deputed from the inhabitants to go to C&aelig;sar, who was
at Corinth on his way to celebrate his triumph after the victory
at Actium.<a name="FNanchor_852" id="FNanchor_852"></a><a href="#Footnote_852" class="fnanchor">852</a> He told his fellow-passengers, that he was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
deputed to apply for an abatement of the tribute, for they
were required to pay 150 drachm&aelig;, when it was with difficulty
they could pay 100.</p>

<p>Aratus,<a name="FNanchor_853" id="FNanchor_853"></a><a href="#Footnote_853" class="fnanchor">853</a> in his Details, intimates how poor they were;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;O Latona, thou art shortly going to pass by me [<i>an insignificant island</i>]
like to the iron-bound Pholegandrus, or to unhappy Gyarus.</p>

<p>4. Although Delos<a name="FNanchor_854" id="FNanchor_854"></a><a href="#Footnote_854" class="fnanchor">854</a> was so famous, yet it became still more
so, and flourished after the destruction of Corinth by the
Romans.<a name="FNanchor_855" id="FNanchor_855"></a><a href="#Footnote_855" class="fnanchor">855</a> For the merchants resorted thither, induced by
the immunities of the temple, and the convenience of its harbour.
It lies favourably<a name="FNanchor_856" id="FNanchor_856"></a><a href="#Footnote_856" class="fnanchor">856</a> for those who are sailing from
Italy and Greece to Asia. The general festival held there
serves the purposes of commerce, and the Romans particularly
frequented it even before the destruction of Corinth.<a name="FNanchor_857" id="FNanchor_857"></a><a href="#Footnote_857" class="fnanchor">857</a> The
Athenians, after having taken the island, paid equal attention
to the affairs both of religion and of commerce. But the
generals<a name="FNanchor_858" id="FNanchor_858"></a><a href="#Footnote_858" class="fnanchor">858</a> of Mithridates, and the tyrant,<a name="FNanchor_859" id="FNanchor_859"></a><a href="#Footnote_859" class="fnanchor">859</a> who had occasioned
the defection of (Athens from the Romans), ravaged it entirely.
The Romans received the island in a desolate state
on the departure of the king to his own country; and it has
continued in an impoverished condition to the present time.<a name="FNanchor_860" id="FNanchor_860"></a><a href="#Footnote_860" class="fnanchor">860</a>
The Athenians are now in possession of it.</p>

<p>5. Rheneia<a name="FNanchor_861" id="FNanchor_861"></a><a href="#Footnote_861" class="fnanchor">861</a> is a small desert island 4 stadia from Delos,
where are the sepulchral monuments of the Delians. For it
is not permitted to bury the dead in Delos, nor to burn a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]<br />[CAS. 486]</a></span>
dead body there. It is not permitted even to keep a dog in
Delos.</p>

<p>Formerly it had the name of Ortygia.<a name="FNanchor_862" id="FNanchor_862"></a><a href="#Footnote_862" class="fnanchor">862</a></p>

<p>6. Ceos<a name="FNanchor_863" id="FNanchor_863"></a><a href="#Footnote_863" class="fnanchor">863</a> once contained four cities. Two remain, Iulis
and Carth&aelig;, to which the inhabitants of the others were
transferred; those of P&#339;&euml;essa to Carth&aelig;, and those of Coressia
to Iulis. Simonides the lyric poet, and Bacchylides his
nephew, and after their times Erasistratus the physician, and
Ariston the Peripatetic philosopher, the imitator of Bion,<a name="FNanchor_864" id="FNanchor_864"></a><a href="#Footnote_864" class="fnanchor">864</a> the
Borysthenite, were natives of this city.</p>

<p>There was an ancient law among these people, mentioned
by Menander.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;Phanias, that is a good law of the Ceans; who cannot live comfortably
(or well), let him not live miserably (or ill).&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_865" id="FNanchor_865"></a><a href="#Footnote_865" class="fnanchor">865</a></p>

<p>For the law, it seems, ordained that those above sixty years
old should be compelled to drink hemlock, in order that there
might be sufficient food for the rest. It is said that once
when they were besieged by the Athenians, a decree was
passed to the effect that the oldest persons, fixing the age,
should be put to death, and that the besiegers retired in consequence.</p>

<p>The city lies on a mountain, at a distance from the sea of
about 25 stadia. Its arsenal is the place on which Coressia
was built, which does not contain the population even of a
village. Near the Coressian territory and P&#339;&euml;essa is a temple
of Apollo Sminthius. But between the temple and the
ruins of P&#339;&euml;essa is the temple of Minerva Nedusia, built by
Nestor, on his return from Troy. The river Elixus runs
around the territory of Coressia.</p>

<p>7. After Ceos are Naxos<a name="FNanchor_866" id="FNanchor_866"></a><a href="#Footnote_866" class="fnanchor">866</a> and Andros,<a name="FNanchor_867" id="FNanchor_867"></a><a href="#Footnote_867" class="fnanchor">867</a> considerable
islands, and Paros, the birth-place of the poet Archilochus.
Thasos<a name="FNanchor_868" id="FNanchor_868"></a><a href="#Footnote_868" class="fnanchor">868</a> was founded by Parians, and Parium,<a name="FNanchor_869" id="FNanchor_869"></a><a href="#Footnote_869" class="fnanchor">869</a> a city in the
Propontis. In this last place there is said to be an altar
worthy of notice, each of whose sides is a stadium in length.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<p>In Paros is obtained the Parian marble, the best adapted for
statuary work.<a name="FNanchor_870" id="FNanchor_870"></a><a href="#Footnote_870" class="fnanchor">870</a></p>

<p>8. Here also is Syros, (the first syllable is long,) where
Pherecydes the son of Babys was born. The Athenian
Pherecydes is younger than the latter person. The poet seems
to have mentioned this island under the name of Syria;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

&#8220;above Ortygia is an island called Syria.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_871" id="FNanchor_871"></a><a href="#Footnote_871" class="fnanchor">871</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>9. Myconus<a name="FNanchor_872" id="FNanchor_872"></a><a href="#Footnote_872" class="fnanchor">872</a> is an island beneath which, according to the
mythologists, lie the last of the giants, destroyed by Hercules;
whence the proverb, &#8220;all under one Myconus,&#8221; applied to
persons who collect under one title things that are disjoined
by nature. Some also call bald persons Miconians, because
baldness is frequent among the inhabitants of the island.<a name="FNanchor_873" id="FNanchor_873"></a><a href="#Footnote_873" class="fnanchor">873</a></p>

<p>10. Seriphos<a name="FNanchor_874" id="FNanchor_874"></a><a href="#Footnote_874" class="fnanchor">874</a> is the island where is laid the scene of the
fable of Dictys, who drew to land in his net the chest in
which were enclosed Perseus and his mother Dana&euml;, who
were thrown into the sea by order of Acrisius, the father
of Dana&euml;. There it is said Perseus was brought up, and
to this island he brought the head of the Gorgon; he exhibited
it to the Seriphians, and turned them all into stone.
This he did to avenge the wrongs of his mother, because their
king Polydectes, with the assistance of his subjects, desired
to make her his wife by force. Seriphus abounds so much
with rocks, that they say in jest that it was the work of the
Gorgon.</p>

<p>11. Tenos<a name="FNanchor_875" id="FNanchor_875"></a><a href="#Footnote_875" class="fnanchor">875</a> has a small city, but there is, in a grove beyond
it, a large temple of Neptune worthy of notice. It contains
large banqueting rooms, a proof of the great multitudes that
repair thither from the neighbouring places to celebrate a feast,
and to perform a common sacrifice in honour of Neptune.</p>

<p>12. To the Sporades belongs Amorgos,<a name="FNanchor_876" id="FNanchor_876"></a><a href="#Footnote_876" class="fnanchor">876</a> the birth-place of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]<br />[CAS. 488]</a></span>
Simonides, the Iambic poet; Lebinthus<a name="FNanchor_877" id="FNanchor_877"></a><a href="#Footnote_877" class="fnanchor">877</a> also, and Leria
(Leros).<a name="FNanchor_878" id="FNanchor_878"></a><a href="#Footnote_878" class="fnanchor">878</a> Phocylides refers to Leria in these lines;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;the Lerians are bad, not some, but all, except Procles; but Procles is
a Lerian;&#8221;</p>

<p>for the Lerians are reputed to have bad dispositions.</p>

<p>13. Near these islands are Patmos,<a name="FNanchor_879" id="FNanchor_879"></a><a href="#Footnote_879" class="fnanchor">879</a> and the Corassi&aelig;<a name="FNanchor_880" id="FNanchor_880"></a><a href="#Footnote_880" class="fnanchor">880</a>
islands, situated to the west of Icaria,<a name="FNanchor_881" id="FNanchor_881"></a><a href="#Footnote_881" class="fnanchor">881</a> as the latter is with
respect to Samos.</p>

<p>Icaria has no inhabitants, but it has pastures, of which the
Samians avail themselves. Notwithstanding its condition it
is famous, and gives the name of Icarian to the sea in front
of it, in which are situated Samos, Cos, and the islands just
mentioned,<a name="FNanchor_882" id="FNanchor_882"></a><a href="#Footnote_882" class="fnanchor">882</a> the Corassi&aelig;, Patmos, and Leros<a name="FNanchor_883" id="FNanchor_883"></a><a href="#Footnote_883" class="fnanchor">883</a> [in Samos is the
mountain the Cerceteus, more celebrated than the Ampelus,
which overhangs the city of the Samians].<a name="FNanchor_884" id="FNanchor_884"></a><a href="#Footnote_884" class="fnanchor">884</a> Continuous to
the Icarian sea, towards the south, is the Carpathian sea, and
the &AElig;gyptian sea to this; to the west are the Cretan and
African seas.</p>

<p><a name="x_v_14" id="x_v_14"></a>14. In the Carpathian sea, between Cos, Rhodes, and Crete,
are situated many of the Sporades, as Astypal&aelig;a,<a name="FNanchor_885" id="FNanchor_885"></a><a href="#Footnote_885" class="fnanchor">885</a> Telos,<a name="FNanchor_886" id="FNanchor_886"></a><a href="#Footnote_886" class="fnanchor">886</a>
Chalcia,<a name="FNanchor_887" id="FNanchor_887"></a><a href="#Footnote_887" class="fnanchor">887</a> and those mentioned by Homer in the Catalogue.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;They who occupied Nisyrus, Crapathus, Casus, and Cos,</div>
<div class="line">The city of Eurypylus, and the Calydn&aelig; islands.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_888" id="FNanchor_888"></a><a href="#Footnote_888" class="fnanchor">888</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Except Cos, and Rhodes, of which we shall speak hereafter,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
we place the rest among the Sporades, and we mention them
here although they do not lie near Europe, but Asia, because
the course of my work induces me to include the Sporades
in the description of Crete and of the Cyclades.</p>

<p>We shall traverse in the description of Asia the considerable
islands adjacent to that country, as Cyprus, Rhodes, Cos,
and those situated on the succeeding line of coast, Samos,
Chios, Lesbos, and Tenedos. At present we are to describe
the remaining islands of the Sporades, which deserve mention.</p>

<p>15. Astypal&aelig;a lies far out at sea, and contains a city.</p>

<p>Telos, which is long, high, and narrow, in circumference
about 140 stadia, with a shelter for vessels, extends along the
Cnidian territory.</p>

<p>Chalcia is distant from Telos 80, from Carpathus 400 stadia,
and about double this number from Astypal&aelig;a. It has a settlement
of the same name, a temple of Apollo, and a harbour.</p>

<p>16. Nisyrus lies to the north of Telos, at the distance of
about 60 stadia, which is its distance also from Cos. It is
round, lofty, and rocky, and has abundance of mill-stone,
whence the neighbouring people are well supplied with stones
for grinding. It contains a city of the same name, a harbour,
hot springs, and a temple of Neptune. Its circumference is
80 stadia. Near it are small islands, called the islands of the
Nisyrians. Nisyrus is said to be a fragment broken off from
Cos; a story is also told of Neptune, that when pursuing Polybotes,
one of the giants, he broke off with his trident a piece
of the island Cos, and hurled it at him, and that the missile
became the island Nisyrus, with the giant lying beneath it.
But some say that the giant lies beneath Cos.</p>

<p>17. Carpathus, which the poet calls Crapathus, is lofty,
having a circumference of 200 stadia. It contained four cities,
and its name was famous, which it imparted to the surrounding
sea. One of the cities was called Nisyrus, after the name
of the island Nisyrus. It lies opposite Leuce Acte in Africa,
which is distant about 1000 stadia from Alexandria, and
about 4000 from Carpathus.</p>

<p>18. Casus is distant from Carpathus 70, and from the promontory
Salmonium in Crete 250 stadia. It is 80 stadia in
circumference. It contains a city of the same name; and many
islands, called the islands of the Casii, lie about it.</p>

<p>19. They say that the poet calls the Sporades, Calydn&aelig;,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]<br />[CAS. 489]</a></span>
one of which is Calymna.<a name="FNanchor_889" id="FNanchor_889"></a><a href="#Footnote_889" class="fnanchor">889</a> But it is probable that as the
islands, which are near and dependent, have their names from
the Nisyrii and Casii, so those that lie around Calymna had
their name from that island, which was then perhaps called
Calydna. Some say that the Calydn&aelig; islands are two, Leros
and Calymna, and that the poet means these. But the Scepsian
says, that the name of the island was used in the plural
number, Calymn&aelig;, like Athen&aelig;, Theb&aelig;, and that the words
of the poet must be understood according to the figure hyperbaton,
or inversion, for he does not say, the islands Calydn&aelig;,
but,</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;they who occupied the islands Nisyrus, Crapathus, Casus, and Cos, the
city of Eurypylus, and Calydn&aelig;.&#8221;</p>

<p>All the honey of the islands is, for the most part, excellent,
and rivals that of Attica; but the honey of these islands surpasses
it, particularly that of Calymna.<a name="FNanchor_890" id="FNanchor_890"></a><a href="#Footnote_890" class="fnanchor">890</a></p>

<h2><big>BOOK XI.<br /><br />

ASIA.</big><br /><br /></h2>

<p class="center f85">SUMMARY.</p>

<p class="indent">The Eleventh Book commences with Asia and the river Don, which, taking
its rise in the northern regions, separates Europe from Asia. It includes
the nations situated in Asia near its sources on the east and south, and
the barbarous Asiatic nations who occupy the neighbourhood of Mount
Caucasus, among whom are the Amazones, Massaget&aelig;, Scythians, Albani,
Iberes, Bactriani, Caspii, Medes, Persians, and the two Armenias,
extending to Mesopotamia. Among these nations are included the Troglodyt&aelig;,
Heniochi, Sceptuchi, Soanes, Assyrians, Polyphagi, Nabiani,
Siraci, and Tapyri. Mention is made of Jason and Medea, and of the
cities founded by them:&mdash;of Xerxes, Mithridates, and Alexander, son of
Philip.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Asia</span> is contiguous to Europe, approaching close to it
at the Tana&iuml;s or Don.</p>

<p>I am to describe this country next, after dividing it, for
the sake of perspicuity, by certain natural boundaries. What
Eratosthenes has done with respect to the whole habitable
earth, this I propose to do with respect to Asia.</p>

<p>2. The Taurus, extending from west to east, embraces the
middle of this continent, like a girdle, leaving one portion to
the north, another to the south. The Greeks call the former
Asia Within the Taurus,<a name="FNanchor_891" id="FNanchor_891"></a><a href="#Footnote_891" class="fnanchor">891</a> the latter, Asia Without the
Taurus. We have said this before, but it is repeated now to
assist the memory.</p>

<p>3. The Taurus has in many places a breadth of 3000
stadia; its length equals that of Asia, namely 45,000 stadia,<a name="FNanchor_892" id="FNanchor_892"></a><a href="#Footnote_892" class="fnanchor">892</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]<br />[CAS. 491]</a></span>
reckoning from the continent opposite to Rhodes to the eastern
extremities of India and Scythia.</p>

<p>4. It is divided into many parts, which are circumscribed
by boundaries of greater or less extent, and distinguished by
various names.</p>

<p>But as such an extended range of mountains must comprise
nations some of which are little known, and others with
whom we are well acquainted, as Parthians,<a name="FNanchor_893" id="FNanchor_893"></a><a href="#Footnote_893" class="fnanchor">893</a> Medes, Armenians,
some of the Cappadocians, Cilicians, and Pisidians;
those which approach near the northern parts must be assigned
to the north, (northern Asia,) those approximating
the southern parts, to the south, (southern Asia,) and those
situated in the middle of the mountains must be placed on
account of the similarity of the temperature of the air, for it
is cold to the north, while the air of the south is warm.</p>

<p>The currents of almost all the rivers which flow from the
Taurus are in a direction contrary to each other, some running
to the north, others to the south, at least at the commencement
of their course, although afterwards some bend
towards the east or west. They naturally suggest the adoption
of this chain of mountains as a boundary in the division
of Asia into two portions; in the same manner that the sea
within the Pillars, which for the most part runs in the same
line with these mountains, conveniently forms two continents,
Europe and Africa, and is a remarkable boundary to
both.</p>

<p>5. In passing in our geographical description from Europe
to Asia, the first parts of the country which present themselves
are those in the northern division, and we shall therefore
begin with these.</p>

<p>Of these parts the first are those about the Tana&iuml;s, (or
Don,) which we have assumed as the boundary of Europe
and Asia. These have a kind of peninsular form, for they are
surrounded on the west by the river Tana&iuml;s (or Don) and
the Palus M&aelig;otis<a name="FNanchor_894" id="FNanchor_894"></a><a href="#Footnote_894" class="fnanchor">894</a> as far as the Cimmerian Bosporus,<a name="FNanchor_895" id="FNanchor_895"></a><a href="#Footnote_895" class="fnanchor">895</a> and
that part of the coast of the Euxine which terminates at
Colchis; on the north by the Ocean, as far as the mouth of
the Caspian Sea; on the east by the same sea, as far as the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
confines of Albania and Armenia, where the rivers Cyrus<a name="FNanchor_896" id="FNanchor_896"></a><a href="#Footnote_896" class="fnanchor">896</a>
and Araxes<a name="FNanchor_897" id="FNanchor_897"></a><a href="#Footnote_897" class="fnanchor">897</a> empty themselves; the latter flowing through
Armenia, and the Cyrus through Iberia<a name="FNanchor_898" id="FNanchor_898"></a><a href="#Footnote_898" class="fnanchor">898</a> and Albania;<a name="FNanchor_899" id="FNanchor_899"></a><a href="#Footnote_899" class="fnanchor">899</a> on
the south is the tract of country extending from the mouth of
the Cyrus as far as Colchis, and comprising about 3000
stadia from sea to sea, across the territory of the Albani, and
Iberes,<a name="FNanchor_900" id="FNanchor_900"></a><a href="#Footnote_900" class="fnanchor">900</a> so as to represent an isthmus.<a name="FNanchor_901" id="FNanchor_901"></a><a href="#Footnote_901" class="fnanchor">901</a></p>

<p>Those writers do not deserve attention who contract the
isthmus as much as Cleitarchus, according to whom it is subject
to inundations of the sea from either side. According to
Posidonius the isthmus is 1500 stadia in extent, that is, as
large as the isthmus from Pelusium to the Red Sea. And I
think, says he, that the isthmus between the Palus M&aelig;otis
and the Ocean is not very different from this in extent.</p>

<p>6. I know not how any one can rely upon his authority
respecting what is uncertain, when he has nothing probable
to advance on the subject; for he reasons so falsely respecting
things which are evident, and this too when he enjoyed the
friendship of Pompey, who had carried on war against the
Iberes and Albani, and was acquainted with both the Caspian
and Colchian<a name="FNanchor_902" id="FNanchor_902"></a><a href="#Footnote_902" class="fnanchor">902</a> Seas on each side of the isthmus. It is
related, that when Pompey<a name="FNanchor_903" id="FNanchor_903"></a><a href="#Footnote_903" class="fnanchor">903</a> was at Rhodes, on his expedition
against the pirates, (he was soon afterwards to carry on
war against Mithridates and the nations as far as the Caspian
Sea,) he accidentally heard a philosophical lecture of Posidonius;
and on his departure he asked Posidonius if he had any
commands; to which he replied,</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>Add to this, that he wrote the history of Pompey. For
these reasons he ought to have paid a greater regard to truth.</p>

<p>7. The second portion is that above the Hyrcanian,<a name="FNanchor_905" id="FNanchor_905"></a><a href="#Footnote_905" class="fnanchor">905</a> which
we also call the Caspian Sea, extending as far as the Scythians
near the Indians.</p>

<p>The third portion is continuous with the above-mentioned
isthmus, and consists of the country following next in
order to the isthmus and the Caspian Gates,<a name="FNanchor_906" id="FNanchor_906"></a><a href="#Footnote_906" class="fnanchor">906</a> and approaching
nearest the parts within the Taurus, and to Europe; these are
Media, Armenia, Cappadocia, and the intervening country.<a name="FNanchor_907" id="FNanchor_907"></a><a href="#Footnote_907" class="fnanchor">907</a></p>

<p>The fourth portion consists of the tract within the Halys,<a name="FNanchor_908" id="FNanchor_908"></a><a href="#Footnote_908" class="fnanchor">908</a>
and the parts upon and without the Taurus, which coincide
with the peninsula formed by the isthmus,<a name="FNanchor_909" id="FNanchor_909"></a><a href="#Footnote_909" class="fnanchor">909</a> which separates
the Euxine and the Cilician Seas. Among the other countries
beyond the Taurus we place Indica and Ariana,<a name="FNanchor_910" id="FNanchor_910"></a><a href="#Footnote_910" class="fnanchor">910</a> as far
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
as the nations which extend to the Persian Sea, the Arabian
Gulf, and the Nile, and to the &AElig;gyptian and the Issic seas.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">According</span> to this disposition, the first portion towards
the north and the Ocean is inhabited by certain tribes of Scythians,
shepherds, (nomades,) and Hamax&#339;ci (or those who
live in waggon-houses). Within these tribes live Sarmatians,
who also are Scythians, Aorsi,<a name="FNanchor_911" id="FNanchor_911"></a><a href="#Footnote_911" class="fnanchor">911</a> and Siraci, extending as far as
the Caucasian Mountains towards the south. Some of these
are Nomades, or shepherd tribes, others Scenit&aelig;, (or dwellers
in tents,) and Georgi, or tillers of the ground. About the
lake M&aelig;otis live the M&aelig;ot&aelig;. Close to the sea is the Asiatic
portion of the Bosporus and Sindica.<a name="FNanchor_912" id="FNanchor_912"></a><a href="#Footnote_912" class="fnanchor">912</a> Next follow Ach&aelig;i,
Zygi, Heniochi,<a name="FNanchor_913" id="FNanchor_913"></a><a href="#Footnote_913" class="fnanchor">913</a> Cercet&aelig;, and Macropogones (or the long-beards).
Above these people are situated the passes of the
Phtheirophagi (or Lice-eaters). After the Heniochi is Colchis,
lying at the foot of the Caucasian and Moschic mountains.
Having assumed the Tana&iuml;s as the boundary of Europe and
Asia, we must begin our description in detail from this river.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]<br />[CAS. 493]</a></span></p>

<p>2. The Tana&iuml;s or Don flows from the northern parts. It does
not however flow in a direction diametrically opposite to the
Nile, as some suppose, but its course is more to the east than
that of the latter river; its sources, like those of the Nile,
are unknown. A great part of the course of the Nile is apparent,
for it traverses a country the whole of which is easy
of access, and its stream is navigable to a great distance from
its mouth. We are acquainted with the mouths of the Don,
(there are two in the most northerly parts of the M&aelig;otis, distant
60 stadia from each other,) but a small part only of the
tract above the mouths is explored, on account of the severity
of the cold, and the destitute state of the country; the
natives are able to endure it, who subsist, like the wandering
shepherd tribes, on the flesh of their animals and on milk, but
strangers cannot bear the climate nor its privations. Besides,
the nomades dislike intercourse with other people, and being
a strong and numerous tribe have excluded travellers from
every part of the country which is accessible, and from all
such rivers as are navigable. For this reason some have supposed
that the sources of the river are among the Caucasian
mountains, that, after flowing in a full stream towards the
north, it then makes a bend, and discharges itself into the
M&aelig;otis. Theophanes<a name="FNanchor_914" id="FNanchor_914"></a><a href="#Footnote_914" class="fnanchor">914</a> of Mitylene is of the same opinion with
these writers. Others suppose that it comes from the higher
parts of the Danube, but they do not produce any proof of so
remote a source, and in other climates, though they seem to
think it impossible for it to rise at no great distance and in
the north.</p>

<p>3. Upon the river, and on the lake, stands a city Tana&iuml;s,
founded by the Greeks, who possess the Bosporus; but
lately the King Polemon<a name="FNanchor_915" id="FNanchor_915"></a><a href="#Footnote_915" class="fnanchor">915</a> laid it waste on account of the refractory
disposition of the inhabitants. It was the common
mart both of the Asiatic and of the European nomades, and
of those who navigate the lake from the Bosporus, some of
whom bring slaves and hides, or any other nomadic commodity;
others exchange wine for clothes, and other articles
peculiar to a civilized mode of life.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<p>In front of the mart at the distance of 100 stadia is an island
Alopecia, a settlement of a mixed people. There are
other small islands not far off in the lake.</p>

<p>The city Tana&iuml;s,<a name="FNanchor_916" id="FNanchor_916"></a><a href="#Footnote_916" class="fnanchor">916</a> to those who sail in a direct line towards
the north, is distant from the mouth of the M&aelig;otis
2200 stadia, nor is the distance much greater in sailing along
the coast (on the east).</p>

<p>4. In the voyage along the coast, the first object which
presents itself to those who have proceeded to the distance of
800 stadia from the Tana&iuml;s, is the Great Rhombites, as it is
called, where large quantities of fish are captured for the purpose
of being salted. Then at the distance of 800 stadia
more is the Lesser Rhombites,<a name="FNanchor_917" id="FNanchor_917"></a><a href="#Footnote_917" class="fnanchor">917</a> and a promontory, which has
smaller fisheries. The [nomades] at the former have small
islands as stations for their vessels, those at the Lesser Rhombites
are the M&aelig;ot&aelig; who cultivate the ground. For along
the whole of this coasting voyage live M&aelig;ot&aelig;, who are husbandmen,
but not less addicted to war than the nomades.
They are divided into several tribes; those near the Tana&iuml;s
are more savage, those contiguous to the Bosporus are more
gentle in their manners.</p>

<p>From the Lesser Rhombites to Tyrambe, and the river Anticeites,
are 600 stadia; then 120 to the Cimmerian village,
whence vessels set out on their voyage along the lake. In
this coasting voyage we meet with some look-out places, (for
observing the fish,) said to belong to the Clazomenians.</p>

<p>5. Cimmericum was formerly a city built upon a peninsula,
the isthmus of which it enclosed with a ditch and mound.
The Cimmerii once possessed great power in the Bosporus,
whence it was called the Cimmerian Bosporus. These are
the people who overran the territory of the inhabitants of
the inland parts, on the right of the Euxine, as far as Ionia.
They were dislodged from these places by Scythians, and the
Scythians by Greeks, who founded Panticap&aelig;um,<a name="FNanchor_918" id="FNanchor_918"></a><a href="#Footnote_918" class="fnanchor">918</a> and the
other cities on the Bosporus.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]<br />[CAS. 494]</a></span></p>

<p>6. Next to the village Achilleium,<a name="FNanchor_919" id="FNanchor_919"></a><a href="#Footnote_919" class="fnanchor">919</a> where is the temple of
Achilles, are 20 stadia. Here is the narrowest passage, 20
stadia or more, across the mouth of the M&aelig;otis; on the opposite
continent is Myrmecium, a village. Near are Heracleium
and Parthenium.</p>

<p>7. Thence to the monument of Satyrus are 90 stadia; this
is a mound raised on a promontory,<a name="FNanchor_920" id="FNanchor_920"></a><a href="#Footnote_920" class="fnanchor">920</a> in memory of one of the
illustrious princes of the Bosporus.</p>

<p>8. Near it is Patr&aelig;us,<a name="FNanchor_921" id="FNanchor_921"></a><a href="#Footnote_921" class="fnanchor">921</a> a village, from which to Corocondame,<a name="FNanchor_922" id="FNanchor_922"></a><a href="#Footnote_922" class="fnanchor">922</a>
a village, are 130 stadia. This is the termination of
the Cimmerian Bosporus, as it is called. The narrow passage
at the mouth of the M&aelig;otis derives its name from the
straits opposite the Achilleium, and the Myrmecium; it extends
as far as Corocondame and a small village opposite to
it in the territory of the Panticap&aelig;ans, called Acra,<a name="FNanchor_923" id="FNanchor_923"></a><a href="#Footnote_923" class="fnanchor">923</a> and
separated by a channel of 70 stadia in width. The ice
reaches even to this place, for the M&aelig;otis is frozen during
severe frost so as to become passable on foot. The whole of
this narrow passage has good harbours.</p>

<p>9. Beyond Corocondame is a large lake<a name="FNanchor_924" id="FNanchor_924"></a><a href="#Footnote_924" class="fnanchor">924</a> which is called
from the place Corocondametis. It discharges itself into the
sea at the distance of 10 stadia from the village. A branch<a name="FNanchor_925" id="FNanchor_925"></a><a href="#Footnote_925" class="fnanchor">925</a>
of the river Anticeites empties itself into the lake, and forms
an island, which is surrounded by the waters of the lake, of
the M&aelig;otis, and of the river. Some persons give this river
the name of Hypanis,<a name="FNanchor_926" id="FNanchor_926"></a><a href="#Footnote_926" class="fnanchor">926</a> as well as to that<a name="FNanchor_927" id="FNanchor_927"></a><a href="#Footnote_927" class="fnanchor">927</a> near the Borysthenes.<a name="FNanchor_928" id="FNanchor_928"></a><a href="#Footnote_928" class="fnanchor">928</a></p>

<p>10. Upon sailing<a name="FNanchor_929" id="FNanchor_929"></a><a href="#Footnote_929" class="fnanchor">929</a> into the Corocondametis, we meet with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
Phanagoria, a considerable city, Cepi, Hermonassa, and Apaturum,
the temple of Venus (Apatura). Of these cities Phanagoria
and Cepi are situated in the above-mentioned island on
the left hand at the entrance of the lake; the others are on
the right hand in Sindica beyond the Hypanis. There is
Gorgipia,<a name="FNanchor_930" id="FNanchor_930"></a><a href="#Footnote_930" class="fnanchor">930</a> but the royal seat of the Sindi is in Sindica near
the sea, and Aborace.</p>

<p>All those who are subject to the princes of the Bosporus
are called Bosporani. The capital of the European Bosporani
is Panticap&aelig;um, and of the Asian Bosporani, the city of
Phanagorium,<a name="FNanchor_931" id="FNanchor_931"></a><a href="#Footnote_931" class="fnanchor">931</a> for this is the name given to it. Phanagoria
seems to be the mart for those commodities which are
brought down from the M&aelig;otis, and from the barbarous country
lying above it; and Panticap&aelig;um, the mart for the commodities
which are transported thither from the sea. There
is also in Phanagoria a magnificent temple of Venus Apatura,
the Deceitful. This epithet of the goddess is derived
from a fable, according to which the giants assaulted her in
this place. Having obtained the assistance of Hercules she hid
him in a cave, and then admitted the giants one by one into
her presence, and delivered them over to Hercules, thus
craftily<a name="FNanchor_932" id="FNanchor_932"></a><a href="#Footnote_932" class="fnanchor">932</a> to be put to death.</p>

<p>11. The Sindi, Dandarii, Toreat&aelig;, Agri, Arrhechi, and
besides these, the Tarpetes, Obidiaceni, Sittaceni, Dosci, and
many others, belong to the M&aelig;ot&aelig;; to this people belong the
Aspurgiani also, who live between Phanagoria and Gorgipia,
at the distance of 500 stadia [from the M&aelig;otis?]. Polemon,
the king, entered the country of these people under a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]<br />[CAS. 495]</a></span>
show of friendship, but his design was discovered, and they
on their part attacked him unawares. He was taken prisoner,
and put to death.</p>

<p>With respect to the Asian M&aelig;ot&aelig; in general, some of
them were the subjects of those who possessed the mart on
the Tana&iuml;s; others, of the Bosporani; and different bodies
have revolted at different times. The princes of the Bosporani
were frequently masters of the country as far as the
Tana&iuml;s, and particularly the last princes, Pharnaces, Asander,
and Polemon.</p>

<p>Pharnaces is said to have once brought even the river
Hypanis over the territory of the Dandarii through some
ancient canal, which he had caused to be cleared, and inundated
the country.</p>

<p>12. Next to Sindica, and Gorgipia upon the sea, is the
sea-coast inhabited by the Ach&aelig;i, Zygi, and Heniochi. It
is for the most part without harbours and mountainous, being
a portion of the Caucasus.</p>

<p>These people subsist by piracy.</p>

<p>Their boats are slender, narrow, light, and capable of holding
about five and twenty men, and rarely thirty. The
Greeks call them camar&aelig;. They say, that at the time of
the expedition of Jason the Ach&aelig;i Phthiot&aelig; founded the
Achaia there, and the Laced&aelig;monians, Heniochia. Their
leaders were Rhecas, and Amphistratus, the charioteers<a name="FNanchor_933" id="FNanchor_933"></a><a href="#Footnote_933" class="fnanchor">933</a> of
the Dioscuri; it is probable that the Heniochi had their
name from these persons. They equip fleets consisting of
these camar&aelig;, and being masters of the sea sometimes attack
vessels of burden, or invade a territory, or even a city.
Sometimes even those who occupy the Bosporus assist them,
by furnishing places of shelter for their vessels, and supply
them with provision and means for the disposal of their
booty. When they return to their own country, not having
places suitable for mooring their vessels, they put their camar&aelig;
on their shoulders, and carry them up into the forests, among
which they live, and where they cultivate a poor soil. When
the season arrives for navigation, they bring them down again
to the coast. Their habits are the same even in a foreign
country, for they are acquainted with wooded tracts, in which,
after concealing their camar&aelig;, they wander about on foot day
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
and night, for the purpose of capturing the inhabitants and
reducing them to slavery. But they readily allow whatever
is taken to be ransomed, and signify this after their departure
to those who have lost their property. In places where there
is a regular government, the injured find means of repelling
them. For, frequently, the pirates are attacked in return, and
are carried off together with their camar&aelig;. But the country
subject to the Romans is not so well protected, in consequence
of the neglect of those who are sent there.</p>

<p>13. Such then is their mode of life. But even these people
are governed by persons called Sceptuchi, and these again
are subject to the authority of tyrants, or of kings. The
Heniochi had four kings at the time that Mithridates Eupator
fled from the country of his ancestors to the Bosporus, and
passed through their country, which was open to him, but he
avoided that of the Zygi on account of its ruggedness, and
the savage character of the people. He proceeded with difficulty
along the sea-coast, frequently embarking in vessels,
till he came to the country of the Ach&aelig;i, by whom he was
hospitably received. He had then completed a journey from
the Phasis of not much less than 4000 stadia.</p>

<p>14. From Corocondame, the course of the voyage is directly
towards the east. At the distance of 180 stadia is the
Sindic harbour, and a city. Then at the distance of 400
stadia is Bata,<a name="FNanchor_934" id="FNanchor_934"></a><a href="#Footnote_934" class="fnanchor">934</a> as it is called, a village with a harbour. It is
at this place that Sinope on the south seems to be directly
opposite to this coast, as Carambis<a name="FNanchor_935" id="FNanchor_935"></a><a href="#Footnote_935" class="fnanchor">935</a> has been said to be opposite
to Criu-Metopon.<a name="FNanchor_936" id="FNanchor_936"></a><a href="#Footnote_936" class="fnanchor">936</a></p>

<p>Next to Bata Artemidorus places the coast of the Cercet&aelig;,
which has places of shelter for vessels, and villages along an
extent of about 850 stadia; then at 500 stadia more the
coast of the Ach&aelig;i, then that of the Heniochi, at 1000 stadia,
then the Great Pityus, from which to Dioscurias are 360
stadia.</p>

<p>The authors most worthy of credit who have written the
history of the Mithridatic wars, enumerate the Ach&aelig;i first,
then Zygi, then Heniochi, then Cercet&aelig;, Moschi, Colchi, and
above these the Phtheirophagi, Soanes, and other smaller
nations about the Caucasus.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]<br />[CAS. 497]</a></span></p>

<p>The direction of the sea-coast is at first, as I have said,
towards the east, with a southern aspect; but from Bata
it makes a bend for a small distance, then fronts the west,
and terminates towards Pityus, and Dioscurias, for these
places are contiguous to the coast of Colchis, which I have
already mentioned. Next to Dioscurias is the remainder of
the coast of Colchis, and Trapezus contiguous to it; where
the coast, having made a considerable turn, then extends
nearly in a straight line, and forms the side on the right hand
of the Euxine, looking to the north.</p>

<p>The whole of the coast of the Ach&aelig;i, and of the other
nations, as far as Dioscurias, and the inland places lying in a
straight line towards the south, are at the foot of the Caucasus.</p>

<p>15. This mountain overhangs both the Euxine and the Caspian
seas, forming a kind of rampart to the isthmus which
separates one sea from the other. To the south it is the
boundary of Albania and Iberia, to the north, of the plains
of the Sarmatians. It is well wooded, and contains various
kinds of timber, and especially trees adapted to ship-building.
Eratosthenes says that the Caucasus is called
Mount Caspius by the natives, a name borrowed perhaps
from the Caspii. It throws out forks towards the south, which
embrace the middle of Iberia, and touch the Armenian and
those called the Moschic mountains,<a name="FNanchor_937" id="FNanchor_937"></a><a href="#Footnote_937" class="fnanchor">937</a> and besides these the
mountains of Scydises, and the Paryadres. All these are
portions of the Taurus, which forms the southern side of
Armenia, and are broken off in a manner from it towards the
north, and extend as far as Caucasus, and the coast of the
Euxine which lies between Colchis and Themiscyra.<a name="FNanchor_938" id="FNanchor_938"></a><a href="#Footnote_938" class="fnanchor">938</a></p>

<p>16. Situated on a bay of this kind, and occupying the most
easterly point of the whole sea, is Dioscurias,<a name="FNanchor_939" id="FNanchor_939"></a><a href="#Footnote_939" class="fnanchor">939</a> called the recess
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
of the Euxine Sea, and the extreme boundary of navigation,
for in this sense we are to understand the proverbial
saying,</p>

<p>Not as if the author of the iambic intended to speak of the
river, nor of the city of the same name upon the river, but
Colchis designated by a part, because from the city and the
river there remains a voyage of not less than 600 stadia in a
straight line to the recess of the bay. This same Dioscurias
is the commencement of the isthmus lying between the Caspian
Sea and the Euxine. It is a common mart of the nations
situated above it, and in its neighbourhood. There assemble
at Dioscurias 70 or, according to some writers who are careless
in their statements,<a name="FNanchor_940" id="FNanchor_940"></a><a href="#Footnote_940" class="fnanchor">940</a> 300 nations. All speak different
languages, from living dispersed in various places and without
intercourse, in consequence of their fierce and savage
manners. They are chiefly Sarmatians, but all of them Caucasian
tribes. So much then respecting Dioscurias.</p>

<p>17. The greater part of the rest of Colchis lies upon the sea.
The Phasis,<a name="FNanchor_941" id="FNanchor_941"></a><a href="#Footnote_941" class="fnanchor">941</a> a large river, flows through it. It has its source
in Armenia, and receives the Glaucus,<a name="FNanchor_942" id="FNanchor_942"></a><a href="#Footnote_942" class="fnanchor">942</a> and the Hippus,<a name="FNanchor_943" id="FNanchor_943"></a><a href="#Footnote_943" class="fnanchor">943</a> which
issue from the neighbouring mountains. Vessels ascend it as
far as the fortress of Sarapana,<a name="FNanchor_944" id="FNanchor_944"></a><a href="#Footnote_944" class="fnanchor">944</a> which is capable of containing
the population even of a city. Persons proceed thence by
land to the Cyrus in four days along a carriage road.<a name="FNanchor_945" id="FNanchor_945"></a><a href="#Footnote_945" class="fnanchor">945</a> Upon
the Phasis is a city of the same name, a mart of the Colchians,
bounded on one side by the river, on another by a lake, on
the third by the sea. Thence it is a voyage of three or two<a name="FNanchor_946" id="FNanchor_946"></a><a href="#Footnote_946" class="fnanchor">946</a>
days to Amisus and Sinope, on account of the softness of the
shores caused by the discharge of rivers.<a name="FNanchor_947" id="FNanchor_947"></a><a href="#Footnote_947" class="fnanchor">947</a></p>

<p>The country is fertile and its produce is good, except the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]<br />[CAS. 498]</a></span>
honey, which has generally a bitter taste. It furnishes all
materials for ship-building. It produces them in great plenty,
and they are conveyed down by its rivers. It supplies flax,
hemp, wax, and pitch, in great abundance. Its linen manufacture
is celebrated, for it was exported to foreign parts;
and those who wish to establish an affinity of race between
the Colchians and the &AElig;gyptians, advance this as a proof of it.</p>

<p>Above the rivers which I have mentioned in the Moschic
territory is the temple of Leucothea,<a name="FNanchor_948" id="FNanchor_948"></a><a href="#Footnote_948" class="fnanchor">948</a> founded by Phrixus<a name="FNanchor_949" id="FNanchor_949"></a><a href="#Footnote_949" class="fnanchor">949</a>
and his oracle, where a ram is not sacrificed. It was once
rich, but was plundered in our time by Pharnaces, and a little
afterwards by Mithridates of Pergamus.<a name="FNanchor_950" id="FNanchor_950"></a><a href="#Footnote_950" class="fnanchor">950</a> For when a country
is devastated, in the words of Euripides,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

&#8220;respect to the gods languishes, and they are not honoured.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_951" id="FNanchor_951"></a><a href="#Footnote_951" class="fnanchor">951</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>18. How great anciently was the celebrity of this country,
appears from the fables which refer obscurely to the expedition
of Jason, who advanced as far even as Media; and still earlier
intimations of it are found in the fables relative to the expedition
of Phrixus. The kings that preceded, and who possessed
the country when it was divided into Sceptuchies,<a name="FNanchor_952" id="FNanchor_952"></a><a href="#Footnote_952" class="fnanchor">952</a>
were not very powerful, but when Mithridates Eupator had
enlarged his territory, this country fell under his dominion.
One of his courtiers was always sent as sub-governor and
administrator of its public affairs. Of this number was Moaphernes,
my mother&#8217;s paternal uncle. It was from this country
that the king derived the greatest part of his supplies for the
equipment of his naval armament. But upon the overthrow
of Mithridates, all the country subject to his power was disunited,
and divided among several persons. At last Polemon
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
obtained possession of Colchis, and after his death his wife
Pythodoris reigned over the Colchians, Trapezus, Pharnacia,
and the Barbarians situated above them, of whom I shall
speak in another place.</p>

<p>The territory of the Moschi, in which is situated the temple,
is divided into three portions, one of which is occupied
by Colchians, another by Iberians, and the third by Armenians.
There is in Iberia on the confines of Colchis, a small
city, the city of Phrixus, the present Idessa, a place of
strength. The river Charis<a name="FNanchor_953" id="FNanchor_953"></a><a href="#Footnote_953" class="fnanchor">953</a> flows near Dioscurias.</p>

<p>19. Among the nations that assemble at Dioscurias are
the Phtheiropagi, who have their appellation from their dirt
and filth.</p>

<p>Near them live the Soanes, not less dirty in their habits,
but superior perhaps to all the tribes in strength and courage.
They are masters of the country around them, and occupy
the heights of Caucasus above Dioscurias. They have a king,
and a council of three hundred persons. They can assemble,
it is said, an army of two hundred thousand men, for all their
people are fighting men, but not distributed into certain orders.
In their country the winter torrents are said to bring down
even gold, which the Barbarians collect in troughs pierced
with holes, and lined with fleeces; and hence the fable of
the golden fleece. Some<a name="FNanchor_954" id="FNanchor_954"></a><a href="#Footnote_954" class="fnanchor">954</a> say that they are called Iberians
(the same name as the western Iberians) from the gold mines
found in both countries. The Soanes use poison of an extraordinary
kind for the points of their weapons; even the odour
of this poison is a cause of suffering to those who are wounded
by arrows thus prepared.</p>

<p>The other neighbouring nations about the Caucasus occupy
barren and narrow tracts of land. But the tribes of the Albanians
and Iberians, who possess nearly the whole of the
above-mentioned isthmus, may also be denominated Caucasian,
and yet they live in a fertile country and capable of
being well peopled.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]<br />[CAS. 499]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">The</span> greater part of Iberia is well inhabited, and contains
cities and villages where the houses have roofs covered
with tiles, and display skill in building; there are market-places
in them, and various kinds of public edifices.</p>

<p>2. Some part of the country is encompassed by the Caucasian
mountains; for branches of this range advance, as I have
said, towards the south. These districts are fruitful, comprise
the whole of Iberia, and extend to Armenia and Colchis.
In the middle is a plain watered by rivers, the largest of
which is the Cyrus, which, rising in Armenia, immediately
enters the above-mentioned plain, having received the Aragus,<a name="FNanchor_955" id="FNanchor_955"></a><a href="#Footnote_955" class="fnanchor">955</a>
which flows at the foot of the Caucasus, and other
streams, passes through a narrow channel into Albania. It
flows however between this country and Armenia in a large
body through plains, which afford excellent pasture. After
having received several rivers, and among these the Alazonius,<a name="FNanchor_956" id="FNanchor_956"></a><a href="#Footnote_956" class="fnanchor">956</a>
Sandobanes, the Rh&#339;taces, and Chanes, all of which
are navigable, it discharges itself into the Caspian Sea. Its
former name was Corus.</p>

<p>3. The plain is occupied by those Iberians who are more
disposed to agriculture, and are inclined to peace. Their
dress is after the Armenian and Median fashion. Those
who inhabit the mountainous country, and they are the most
numerous, are addicted to war, live like the Sarmatians and
Scythians, on whose country they border, and with whom
they are connected by affinity of race. These people however
engage in agriculture also, and can assemble many
myriads of persons from among themselves, and from the
Scythians and Sarmatians, whenever any disturbance occurs.</p>

<p>4. There are four passes into the country; one through
Sarapana, a Colchian fortress, and through the defiles near it,
along which the Phasis, rendered passable from one side
to the other by a hundred and twenty bridges, in consequence
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
of the winding of its stream, descends abruptly and
violently into Colchis. The places in its course are hollowed
by numerous torrents, during the rainy season. It rises in
the mountains which lie above, and many springs contribute
to swell its stream. In the plains it receives other rivers
also, among which are the Glaucus<a name="FNanchor_957" id="FNanchor_957"></a><a href="#Footnote_957" class="fnanchor">957</a> and the Hippus.<a name="FNanchor_958" id="FNanchor_958"></a><a href="#Footnote_958" class="fnanchor">958</a> The
stream thus filled and navigable discharges itself into the
Pontus. It has on its banks a city of the same name, and
near it a lake. Such is the nature of the entrance into
Iberia from Colchis, shut in by rocks and strongholds, and
by rivers running through ravines.</p>

<p>5. From the Nomades on the north there is a difficult
ascent for three days, and then a narrow road by the side of
the river Aragus, a journey of four days, which road admits
only one person to pass at a time. The termination of the
road is guarded by an impregnable wall.</p>

<p>From Albania the entrance is at first cut through rocks,
then passes over a marsh formed by the river (Alazonius),<a name="FNanchor_959" id="FNanchor_959"></a><a href="#Footnote_959" class="fnanchor">959</a>
in its descent from the Caucasus. On the side of Armenia are
the narrow passes on the Cyrus, and those on the Aragus, for
before the junction of these rivers they have on their banks
strong cities set upon rocks, at the distance from each other
of about 18 stadia, as Harmozica<a name="FNanchor_960" id="FNanchor_960"></a><a href="#Footnote_960" class="fnanchor">960</a> on the Cyrus, and on the
other (Aragus) Seusamora. Pompey formerly in his way
from Armenia, and afterwards Canidius, marched through
these passes into Iberia.</p>

<p>6. The inhabitants of this country are also divided into
four classes; the first and chief is that from which the kings
are appointed. The king is the oldest and the nearest of his
predecessor&#8217;s relations. The second administers justice, and
is commander of the army.</p>

<p>The second class consists of priests, whose business it is to
settle the respective rights of their own and the bordering
people.</p>

<p>The third is composed of soldiers and husbandmen. The
fourth comprehends the common people, who are royal slaves,
and perform all the duties of ordinary life.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]<br />[CAS. 501]</a></span></p>

<p>Possessions are common property in families, but the eldest
governs, and is the steward of each.</p>

<p>Such is the character of the Iberians, and the nature of
their country.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">The</span> Albanians pursue rather a shepherd life, and resemble
more the nomadic tribes, except that they are not savages,
and hence they are little disposed to war. They inhabit the
country between the Iberians and the Caspian Sea, approaching
close to the sea on the east, and on the west border upon
the Iberians.</p>

<p>Of the remaining sides the northern is protected by the
Caucasian mountains, for these overhang the plains, and are
called, particularly those near the sea, Ceraunian mountains.
The southern side is formed by Armenia, which extends
along it. A large portion of it consists of plains, and a
large portion also of mountains, as Cambysene, where the
Armenians approach close both to the Iberians and the Albanians.</p>

<p>2. The Cyrus, which flows through Albania, and the other
rivers which swell the stream of the Cyrus, improve the
qualities of the land, but remove the sea to a distance. For
the mud, accumulating in great quantity, fills up the channel
in such a manner, that the small adjacent islands are annexed
to the continent, irregular marshes are formed, and
difficult to be avoided; the reverberation also of the tide increases
the irregular formation of the marshes. The mouth
of the river is said to be divided into twelve branches, some
of which afford no passage through them, others are so shallow
as to leave no shelter for vessels. The shore for an extent
of more than 60 stadia is inundated by the sea, and by the
rivers; all that part of it is inaccessible; the mud reaches
even as far as 500 stadia, and forms a bank along the coast.
The Araxes<a name="FNanchor_961" id="FNanchor_961"></a><a href="#Footnote_961" class="fnanchor">961</a> discharges its waters not far off, coming with
an impetuous stream from Armenia, but the mud which this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
river impels forward, making the channel pervious, is replaced
by the Cyrus.</p>

<p>3. Perhaps such a race of people have no need of the sea,
for they do not make a proper use even of the land, which
produces every kind of fruit, even the most delicate, and
every kind of plant and evergreen. It is not cultivated with
the least care; but all that is excellent grows without sowing,
and without ploughing, according to the accounts of persons
who have accompanied armies there, and describe the inhabitants
as leading a Cyclopean mode of life. In many places the
ground, which has been sowed once, produces two or three
crops, the first of which is even fifty-fold, and that without
a fallow, nor is the ground turned with an iron instrument,
but with a plough made entirely of wood. The whole plain
is better watered than Babylon or &AElig;gypt, by rivers and
streams, so that it always presents the appearance of herbage,
and it affords excellent pasture. The air here is better than
in those countries. The vines remain always without digging
round them, and are pruned every five years. The young
trees bear fruit even the second year, but the full grown
yield so much that a large quantity of it is left on the
branches. The cattle, both tame and wild, thrive well in this
country.</p>

<p>4. The men are distinguished for beauty of person and for
size. They are simple in their dealings and not fraudulent,
for they do not in general use coined money; nor are they
acquainted with any number above a hundred, and transact
their exchanges by loads. They are careless with regard to
the other circumstances of life. They are ignorant of weights
and measures as far as exactness is concerned; they are improvident
with respect to war, government, and agriculture.
They fight however on foot and on horseback, both in light
and in heavy armour, like the Armenians.</p>

<p>5. They can send into the field a larger army than the
Iberians, for they can equip 60,000 infantry and 22,000
horsemen; with such a force they offered resistance to Pompey.
The Nomades also co-operate with them against foreigners,
as they do with the Iberians on similar occasions. When
there is no war they frequently attack these people and prevent
them from cultivating the ground. They use javelins
and bows, and wear breastplates, shields, and coverings for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]<br />[CAS. 502]</a></span>
the head, made of the hides of wild animals, like the Iberians.</p>

<p>To the country of the Albanians belongs Caspiana, and has
its name from the Caspian tribe, from whom the sea also has
its appellation; the Caspian tribe is now extinct.</p>

<p>The entrance from Iberia into Albania is through the Cambysene,
a country without water, and rocky, to the river Alazonius.
The people themselves and their dogs are excessively
fond of the chase, pursuing it with equal eagerness
and skill.</p>

<p>6. Their kings differ from one another; at present one king
governs all the tribes. Formerly each tribe was governed by
a king, who spoke the peculiar language of each. They
speak six and twenty languages from the want of mutual
intercourse and communication with one another.</p>

<p>The country produces some venomous reptiles, as scorpions
and tarantulas. These tarantulas cause death in some instances
by laughter, in others by grief and a longing to return home.</p>

<p>7. The gods they worship are the Sun, Jupiter, and the
Moon, but the Moon above the rest. She has a temple near
Iberia. The priest is a person who, next to the king, receives
the highest honours. He has the government of the
sacred land, which is extensive and populous, and authority
over the sacred attendants, many of whom are divinely inspired,
and prophesy. Whoever of these persons, being violently
possessed, wanders alone in the woods, is seized by the
priest, who, having bound him with sacred fetters, maintains
him sumptuously during that year. Afterwards he is brought
forth at the sacrifice performed in honour of the goddess, and
is anointed with fragrant ointment and sacrificed together with
other victims. The sacrifice is performed in the following
manner. A person, having in his hand a sacred lance, with
which it is the custom to sacrifice human victims, advances out
of the crowd and pierces the heart through the side, which he
does from experience in this office. When the man has fallen,
certain prognostications are indicated by the manner of the
fall, and these are publicly declared. The body is carried away
to a certain spot, and then they all trample upon it, performing
this action as a mode of purification of themselves.</p>

<p>8. The Albanians pay the greatest respect to old age, which
is not confined to their parents, but is extended to old persons
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
in general. It is regarded as impious to show any concern
for the dead, or to mention their names. Their money is buried
with them, hence they live in poverty, having no patrimony.</p>

<p>So much concerning the Albanians. It is said that when
Jason, accompanied by Armenus the Thessalian, undertook
the voyage to the Colchi, they advanced as far as the Caspian
Sea, and traversed Iberia, Albania, a great part of Armenia,
and Media, as the Jasoneia and many other monuments testify.
Armenus, they say, was a native of Armenium, one of
the cities on the lake B&#339;beis, between Pher&aelig; and Parisa, and
that his companions settled in Acilisene, and the Suspiritis,
and occupied the country as far as Calachene and Adiabene,
and that he gave his own name to Armenia.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">The</span> Amazons are said to live among the mountains
above Albania. Theophanes, who accompanied Pompey in
his wars, and was in the country of the Albanians, says that
Gel&aelig; and Leg&aelig;,<a name="FNanchor_962" id="FNanchor_962"></a><a href="#Footnote_962" class="fnanchor">962</a> Scythian tribes, live between the Amazons
and the Albanians, and that the river Mermadalis<a name="FNanchor_963" id="FNanchor_963"></a><a href="#Footnote_963" class="fnanchor">963</a> takes its
course in the country lying in the middle between these
people and the Amazons. But other writers, and among
these Metrodorus of Scepsis, and Hypsicrates, who were
themselves acquainted with these places, say that the Amazons
bordered upon the Gargarenses<a name="FNanchor_964" id="FNanchor_964"></a><a href="#Footnote_964" class="fnanchor">964</a> on the north, at the
foot of the Caucasian mountains, which are called Ceraunia.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]<br />[CAS. 504]</a></span></p>

<p>When at home they are occupied in performing with their
own hands the work of ploughing, planting, pasturing cattle,
and particularly in training horses. The strongest among
them spend much of their time in hunting on horseback, and
practise warlike exercises. All of them from infancy have
the right breast seared, in order that they may use the arm with
ease for all manner of purposes, and particularly for throwing
the javelin. They employ the bow also, and sagaris,
(a kind of sword,) and wear a buckler. They make helmets,
and coverings for the body, and girdles, of the skins of wild
animals. They pass two months of the spring on a neighbouring
mountain, which is the boundary between them and
the Gargarenses. The latter also ascend the mountain according
to some ancient custom for the purpose of performing
common sacrifices, and of having intercourse with the
women with a view to offspring, in secret and in darkness,
the man with the first woman he meets. When the women
are pregnant they are sent away. The female children that
may be born are retained by the Amazons themselves, but
the males are taken to the Gargarenses to be brought up.
The children are distributed among families, in which the
master treats them as his own, it being impossible to ascertain
the contrary.</p>

<p>2. The Mermodas,<a name="FNanchor_965" id="FNanchor_965"></a><a href="#Footnote_965" class="fnanchor">965</a> descending like a torrent from the
mountains through the country of the Amazons, the Siracene,
and the intervening desert, discharges itself into the M&aelig;otis.<a name="FNanchor_966" id="FNanchor_966"></a><a href="#Footnote_966" class="fnanchor">966</a></p>

<p>It is said that the Gargarenses ascended together with the
Amazons from Themiscyra to these places, that they then
separated, and with the assistance of some Thracians and
Eub&#339;ans, who had wandered as far as this country, made war
against the Amazons, and at length, upon its termination, entered
into a compact on the conditions above mentioned, namely,
that there should be a companionship only with respect to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
offspring, and that they should live each independent of the
other.</p>

<p>3. There is a peculiarity in the history of the Amazons.
In other histories the fabulous and the historical parts are
kept distinct. For what is ancient, false, and marvellous is
called fable. But history has truth for its object, whether
it be old or new, and it either rejects or rarely admits the
marvellous. But, with regard to the Amazons, the same facts
are related both by modern and by ancient writers; they are
marvellous and exceed belief. For who can believe that an
army of women, or a city, or a nation, could ever subsist
without men? and not only subsist, but make inroads upon
the territory of other people, and obtain possession not only
of the places near them, and advance even as far as the present
Ionia, but even despatch an expedition across the sea to
Attica? This is as much as to say that the men of those
days were women, and the women men. But even now the
same things are told of the Amazons, and the peculiarity of
their history is increased by the credit which is given to
ancient, in preference to modern, accounts.</p>

<p>4. They are said to have founded cities, and to have given
their names to them, as Ephesus, Smyrna, Cyme, Myrina,
besides leaving sepulchres and other memorials. Themiscyra,
the plains about the Thermodon, and the mountains lying
above, are mentioned by all writers as once belonging to the
Amazons, from whence, they say, they were driven out. Where
they are at present few writers undertake to point out, nor do
they advance proofs or probability for what they state; as in
the case of Thalestria, queen of the Amazons, with whom
Alexander is said to have had intercourse in Hyrcania with
the hope of having offspring. Writers are not agreed on this
point, and among many who have paid the greatest regard to
truth none mention the circumstance, nor do writers of the
highest credit mention anything of the kind, nor do those who
record it relate the same facts. Cleitarchus says that Thalestria
set out from the Caspian Gates and Thermodon to
meet Alexander. Now from the Caspian Gates to Thermodon
are more than 6000 stadia.</p>

<p>5. Stories circulated for the purpose of exalting the fame
[of eminent persons] are not received with equal favour by
all; the object of the inventors was flattery rather than truth;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]<br />[CAS. 505]</a></span>
they transferred, for example, the Caucasus to the mountains
of India, and to the eastern sea, which approaches close to
them, from the mountains situated above Colchis, and the
Euxine Sea. These are the mountains to which the Greeks
give the name of Caucasus, and are distant more than 30,000
stadia from India. Here they lay the scene of Prometheus
and his chains, for these were the farthest places towards the
east with which the people of those times were acquainted.
The expeditions of Bacchus and of Hercules against the
Indi indicate a mythological story of later date, for Hercules
is said to have released Prometheus a thousand years after he
was first chained to the rock. It was more glorious too for
Alexander to subjugate Asia as far as the mountains of India,
than to the recess only of the Euxine Sea and the Caucasus.
The celebrity, and the name of the mountain, together with
the persuasion that Jason and his companions had accomplished
the most distant of all expeditions when they had
arrived in the neighbourhood of the Caucasus, and the tradition
that Prometheus had been chained on Caucasus at the
extremity of the earth, induced writers to suppose that they
should gratify the king by transferring the name of the
mountain to India.</p>

<p>6. The highest points of the actual Caucasus are the most
southerly, and lie near Albania, Iberia, the Colchi, and Heniochi.
They are inhabited by the people whom I have mentioned
as assembling at Dioscurias. They resort thither
chiefly for the purpose of procuring salt. Of these tribes
some occupy the heights; others live in wooded valleys, and
subsist chiefly on the flesh of wild animals, wild fruits, and
milk. The heights are impassable in winter; in summer they
are ascended by fastening on the feet shoes as wide as drums,
made of raw hide, and furnished with spikes on account of the
snow and ice. The natives in descending with their loads
slide down seated upon skins, which is the practice in Media,
Atropatia, and at Mount Masius in Armenia, but there they
fasten circular disks of wood with spikes to the soles of their
feet. Such then is the nature of the heights of Caucasus.</p>

<p>7. On descending to the country lying at the foot of these
heights the climate is more northerly, but milder, for the
land below the heights joins the plains of the Siraces. There
are some tribes of Troglodyt&aelig; who inhabit caves on account
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
of the cold. There is plenty<a name="FNanchor_967" id="FNanchor_967"></a><a href="#Footnote_967" class="fnanchor">967</a> of grain to be had in the
country.</p>

<p>Next to the Troglodyt&aelig; are Cham&aelig;c&#339;t&aelig;,<a name="FNanchor_968" id="FNanchor_968"></a><a href="#Footnote_968" class="fnanchor">968</a> and a tribe called
Polyphagi (the voracious), and the villages of the Eisadici,
who are able to cultivate the ground because they are not
altogether exposed to the north.</p>

<p>8. Immediately afterwards follow shepherd tribes, situated
between the M&aelig;otis and the Caspian Sea, Nabiani, Pangani,<a name="FNanchor_969" id="FNanchor_969"></a><a href="#Footnote_969" class="fnanchor">969</a>
the tribes also of the Siraces and Aorsi.</p>

<p>The Aorsi and Siraces seem to be a fugitive people from
parts situated above. The Aorsi lie more to the north.<a name="FNanchor_970" id="FNanchor_970"></a><a href="#Footnote_970" class="fnanchor">970</a></p>

<p>Abeacus, king of the Siraces, when Pharnases occupied
the Bosporus, equipped 20,000 horse, and Spadines, king of
the Aorsi 200,000, and the Upper Aorsi even a larger body,
for they were masters of a greater extent of territory, and
nearly the largest part of the coast of the Caspian Sea was
under their power. They were thus enabled to transport on
camels the merchandise of India and Babylonia, receiving
it from Armenians and Medes. They wore gold also in their
dress in consequence of their wealth.</p>

<p>The Aorsi live on the banks of the Tana&iuml;s, and the Siraces
on those of Achardeus, which rises in Caucasus, and discharges
itself into the M&aelig;otis.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">The</span> second portion of northern Asia begins from the
Caspian Sea, where the first terminates. This sea is called
also the Hyrcanian Sea. We must first speak of this sea, and
of the nations that live near its shores.</p>

<p>It is a bay extending from the Ocean to the south. At its
commencement it is very narrow; as it advances further inwards,
and particularly towards the extremity, it widens to
the extent of about 500 stadia. The voyage from the entrance
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]<br />[CAS. 507]</a></span>
to the extremity may exceed that a little, the entrance approaching
very near the uninhabited regions.</p>

<p>Eratosthenes says that the navigation of this sea was known
to the Greeks, that the part of the voyage along the coast of
the Albanians and Cadus&iuml;i<a name="FNanchor_971" id="FNanchor_971"></a><a href="#Footnote_971" class="fnanchor">971</a> comprised 5400 stadia; and the
part along the country of the Anariaci, Mardi, [or Amardi,]
and Hyrcani, as far as the mouth of the river Oxus,<a name="FNanchor_972" id="FNanchor_972"></a><a href="#Footnote_972" class="fnanchor">972</a> 4800
stadia, and thence to the Iaxartes<a name="FNanchor_973" id="FNanchor_973"></a><a href="#Footnote_973" class="fnanchor">973</a> 2400 stadia.</p>

<p>But with respect to the places situated in this portion of
Asia, and to those lying so far removed from our own country,
we must not understand the accounts of writers in too
literal a sense, particularly with regard to distances.</p>

<p>2. Upon sailing into the Caspian, on the right hand, contiguous
to the Europeans, Scythians and Sarmatians occupy
the country between the Tana&iuml;s and this sea; they are chiefly
Nomades, or shepherd tribes, of whom I have already spoken.
On the left hand are the Eastern Scythian Nomades, who
extend as far as the Eastern sea, and India.</p>

<p>The ancient Greek historians called all the nations towards
the north by the common name of Scythians, and Kelto-Scythians.
Writers still more ancient than these called the nations
living above the Euxine, Danube, and Adriatic, Hyperboreans,
Sauromat&aelig;, and Arimaspi.<a name="FNanchor_974" id="FNanchor_974"></a><a href="#Footnote_974" class="fnanchor">974</a> But in speaking of the nations
on the other side the Caspian Sea, they called some Sac&aelig;,<a name="FNanchor_975" id="FNanchor_975"></a><a href="#Footnote_975" class="fnanchor">975</a>
others Massaget&aelig;. They were unable to give any exact account
of them, although they relate the history of the war of
Cyrus with the Massaget&aelig;. Concerning these nations no one
has ascertained the truth, and the ancient histories of Persia,
Media, and Syria have not obtained much credit on account of
the credulity of the writers and their love of fable.</p>

<p>3. For these authors, having observed that those who professedly
were writers of fables obtained repute and success,
supposed that they also should make their writings agreeable,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
if, under the form of history, they related what they had
never seen nor heard, (not at least from eye-witnesses,) and
had no other object than to please and surprise the reader.
A person would more readily believe the stories of the heroes
in Hesiod, Homer, and in the tragic poets, than Ctesias, Herodotus,
Hellanicus, and writers of this kind.</p>

<p>4. We cannot easily credit the generality of the historians of
Alexander, for they practise deception with a view to enhance
the glory of Alexander; the expedition also was directed
to the extremities of Asia, at a great distance from our
country, and it is difficult to ascertain or detect the truth or
falsehood of what is remote. The dominion of the Romans
and of the Parthians has added very much to former discoveries,
and the writers who speak of these people describe
nations and places, where certain actions were performed, in a
manner more likely to produce belief than preceding historians,
for they had better opportunities of personal observation.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER VII.</h3>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">The</span> nomades, or wandering tribes, who live on the left
side of the coast on entering the Caspian Sea, are called by
the moderns Dah&aelig;, and surnamed Parni.<a name="FNanchor_976" id="FNanchor_976"></a><a href="#Footnote_976" class="fnanchor">976</a> Then there intervenes
a desert tract, which is followed by Hyrcania; here the
Caspian spreads like a deep sea till it approaches the Median
and Armenian mountains. The shape of these hills at the
foot is lunated.<a name="FNanchor_977" id="FNanchor_977"></a><a href="#Footnote_977" class="fnanchor">977</a> Their extremities terminate at the sea, and
form the recess of the bay.</p>

<p>A small part of this country at the foot of the mountains,
as far as the heights, if we reckon from the sea, is inhabited by
some tribes of Albanians and Armenians, but the greater portion
by Gel&aelig;, Cadusii, Amardi, Vitii, and Anariac&aelig;. It is said,
that some Parrhasii were settled together with the Anariac&aelig;,
who are now called Parrhasii, (Parsii?) and that the &AElig;nianes
built a walled city in the territory of the Vitii, which city is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]<br />[CAS. 508]</a></span>
now called &AElig;niana (&AElig;nia). Grecian armour, brazen vessels,
and sepulchres are shown there. There also is a city Anariac&aelig;,
in which it is said an oracle is shown, where the
answer is given to those who consult it, during sleep, [and
some vestiges of Greek colonization, but all these] tribes are
predatory, and more disposed to war than husbandry, which
arises from the rugged nature of the country. The greater
part of the coast at the foot of the mountainous region is occupied
by Cadusii, to the extent of nearly 5000 stadia, according
to Patrocles, who thinks that this sea equals the Euxine
in size. These countries are sterile.</p>

<p>2. Hyrcania<a name="FNanchor_978" id="FNanchor_978"></a><a href="#Footnote_978" class="fnanchor">978</a> is very fertile, and extensive, consisting for
the most part of plains, and has considerable cities dispersed
throughout it, as Talabroce, Samariane, Carta, and the royal
residence, Tape,<a name="FNanchor_979" id="FNanchor_979"></a><a href="#Footnote_979" class="fnanchor">979</a> which is said to be situated a little above
the sea, and distant 1400 stadia from the Caspian Gates. The
following facts are narrated as indications of the fertility of
the country.<a name="FNanchor_980" id="FNanchor_980"></a><a href="#Footnote_980" class="fnanchor">980</a> The vine produces a metretes<a name="FNanchor_981" id="FNanchor_981"></a><a href="#Footnote_981" class="fnanchor">981</a> of wine; the
fig-tree sixty medimni<a name="FNanchor_982" id="FNanchor_982"></a><a href="#Footnote_982" class="fnanchor">982</a> of fruit; the corn grows from the
seed which falls out of the stalk; bees make their hives in
the trees, and honey drops from among the leaves. This is
the case also in the territory of Matiane in Media, and in the
Sacasene, and Araxene of Armenia.<a name="FNanchor_983" id="FNanchor_983"></a><a href="#Footnote_983" class="fnanchor">983</a></p>

<p>But neither this country, nor the sea which is named after
it, has received proper care and attention from the inhabitants,
for there are no vessels upon the sea, nor is it turned to
any use. According to some writers there are islands on it, capable
of being inhabited, in which gold is found. The cause of
this neglect is this; the first governors of Hyrcania were
barbarians, Medes, and Persians, and lastly, people who were
more oppressive than these, namely, Parthians. The whole
of the neighbouring country was the haunt of robbers and
wandering tribes, and abounded with tracts of desert land.
For a short time Macedonians were sovereigns of the country,
but being engaged in war were unable to attend to remote
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
possessions. Aristobulus says that Hyrcania has forests, and
produces the oak, but not the pitch pine,<a name="FNanchor_984" id="FNanchor_984"></a><a href="#Footnote_984" class="fnanchor">984</a> nor the fir,<a name="FNanchor_985" id="FNanchor_985"></a><a href="#Footnote_985" class="fnanchor">985</a> nor the
pine,<a name="FNanchor_986" id="FNanchor_986"></a><a href="#Footnote_986" class="fnanchor">986</a> but that India abounds with these trees.</p>

<p>Nes&aelig;a<a name="FNanchor_987" id="FNanchor_987"></a><a href="#Footnote_987" class="fnanchor">987</a> belongs to Hyrcania, but some writers make it an
independent district.</p>

<p>3. Hyrcania<a name="FNanchor_988" id="FNanchor_988"></a><a href="#Footnote_988" class="fnanchor">988</a> is watered by the rivers Ochus and Oxus as
far as their entrance into the sea. The Ochus flows through
Nes&aelig;a, but some writers say that the Ochus empties itself
into the Oxus.</p>

<p>Aristobulus avers that the Oxus was the largest river, except
those in India, which he had seen in Asia. He says
also that it is navigable with ease, (this circumstance both
Aristobulus and Eratosthenes borrow from Patrocles,) and
that large quantities of Indian merchandise are conveyed by
it to the Hyrcanian Sea, and are transferred from thence into
Albania by the Cyrus, and through the adjoining countries to
the Euxine. The Ochus is not often mentioned by the ancients,
but Apollodorus, the author of the Parthica, frequently
mentions it, [and describes it] as flowing very near the Parthians.</p>

<p>4. Many additional falsehoods were invented inspecting
this sea, to flatter the ambition of Alexander and his love of
glory; for, as it was generally acknowledged that the river
Tana&iuml;s separated Europe from Asia throughout its whole
course, and that a large part of Asia, lying between this sea
and the Tana&iuml;s, had never been subjected to the power of the
Macedonians, it was resolved to invent an expedition, in order
that, according to fame at least, Alexander might seem to
have conquered those countries. They therefore made the
lake M&aelig;otis, which receives the Tana&iuml;s, and the Caspian Sea,
which also they call a lake, one body of water, affirming that
there was a subterraneous opening between both, and that
one was part of the other. Polycleitus produces proofs to
show that this sea is a lake, for instance, that it breeds serpents,
and that the water is sweetish.<a name="FNanchor_989" id="FNanchor_989"></a><a href="#Footnote_989" class="fnanchor">989</a> That it was not a different
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]<br />[CAS. 510]</a></span>
lake from the M&aelig;otis, he conjectures from the circumstance
of the Tana&iuml;s discharging itself into it. From the
same mountains in India, where the Ochus and the Oxus rise,
many other rivers take their course, and among these the
Iaxartes, which like the former empties itself into the Caspian
Sea, although it is the most northerly of them all. This
river then they called Tana&iuml;s, and alleged, as a proof that it
was the Tana&iuml;s mentioned by Polycleitus, that the country on
the other side of the river produced the fir-tree, and that the
Scythians there used arrows made of fir-wood. It was a
proof also that the country on the other side of the river was
a part of Europe and not of Asia, that Upper and Eastern Asia
do not produce the fir-tree. But Eratosthenes says that the
fir does grow even in India, and that Alexander built his
ships of that wood. Eratosthenes collects many things of this
kind, with a view to show their contradictory character. But
I have said enough about them.</p>

<p>5. Among the peculiarities recorded of the Hyrcanian sea,
Eudoxus and others relate the following. There is a certain
coast in front of the sea hollowed out into caverns, between
which and the sea there lies a flat shore. Rivers on reaching
this coast descend from the precipices above with sufficient force
to dart the water into the sea without wetting the intervening
shore, so that even an army could pass underneath sheltered
by the stream above. The inhabitants frequently resort to
this place for the purposes of festivity and of performing
sacrifices, one while reclining beneath the caverns, at another
basking in the sun (even) beneath the fall of water. They
divert themselves in various ways, having in sight on each
side the sea and shore, the latter of which by the dew [and
moisture of the falls] is rendered a grassy and flowery meadow.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">In</span> proceeding from the Hyrcanian Sea towards the east,
on the right hand are the mountains which the Greeks call
Taurus, extending as far as India. They begin from Pamphylia
and Cilicia, and stretch to this part from the west in
a continuous line, bearing different names in different places.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
The northern parts<a name="FNanchor_990" id="FNanchor_990"></a><a href="#Footnote_990" class="fnanchor">990</a> of this range are occupied first by Gel&aelig;,
Cadusii, and Amardi, as we have said, and by some tribes of
Hyrcanians; then follow, as we proceed towards the east
and the Ochus, the nation of the Parthians, then that of the
Margiani and Arii, and the desert country which the river
Sarnius separates from Hyrcania. The mountain, which extends
to this country, or within a small distance of it, from
Armenia, is called Parachoathras.</p>

<p>From the Hyrcanian sea to the Arii are about 6000 stadia.<a name="FNanchor_991" id="FNanchor_991"></a><a href="#Footnote_991" class="fnanchor">991</a>
Next follow Bactriana, Sogdiana, and lastly nomade Scythians.
The Macedonians gave the name of Caucasus to all the
mountains which follow after Ariana,<a name="FNanchor_992" id="FNanchor_992"></a><a href="#Footnote_992" class="fnanchor">992</a> but among the barbarians
the heights and the northern parts of the Parapomisus
were called Emoda, and Mount Imaus;<a name="FNanchor_993" id="FNanchor_993"></a><a href="#Footnote_993" class="fnanchor">993</a> and other
names of this kind were assigned to each portion of this
range.</p>

<p>2. On the left hand<a name="FNanchor_994" id="FNanchor_994"></a><a href="#Footnote_994" class="fnanchor">994</a> opposite to these parts are situated
the Scythian and nomadic nations, occupying the whole of
the northern side. Most of the Scythians, beginning from
the Caspian Sea, are called Dah&aelig; Scyth&aelig;, and those situated
more towards the east Massaget&aelig; and Sac&aelig;; the rest have
the common appellation of Scythians, but each separate tribe
has its peculiar name. All, or the greatest part of them, are
nomades. The best known tribes are those who deprived
the Greeks of Bactriana, the Asii, Pasiani, (Asiani?) Tochari,
and Sacarauli, who came from the country on the other side
of the Iaxartes,<a name="FNanchor_995" id="FNanchor_995"></a><a href="#Footnote_995" class="fnanchor">995</a> opposite the Sac&aelig; and Sogdiani, and which
country was also occupied by Sac&aelig;; some tribes of the
Dah&aelig; are surnamed Aparni, some Xanthii, others Pissuri.<a name="FNanchor_996" id="FNanchor_996"></a><a href="#Footnote_996" class="fnanchor">996</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]<br />[CAS. 511]</a></span>
The Aparni approach the nearest of any of these people to
Hyrcania, and to the Caspian Sea. The others extend as far
as the country opposite to Aria.</p>

<p>3. Between these people, Hyrcania, and Parthia as far as
Aria lies a vast and arid desert, which they crossed by long
journeys, and overran Hyrcania, the Nes&aelig;an country, and
the plains of Parthia. These people agreed to pay a tribute
on condition of having permission to overrun the country at
stated times, and to carry away the plunder. But when these
incursions became more frequent than the agreement allowed,
war ensued, afterwards peace was made, and then again war
was renewed. Such is the kind of life which the other Nomades
also lead, continually attacking their neighbours, and
then making peace with them.</p>

<p><a name="xi_viii_14" id="xi_viii_14"></a>4. The Sac&aelig; had made incursions similar to those of the
Cimmerians and Treres, some near their own country, others
at a greater distance. They occupied Bactriana, and got
possession of the most fertile tract in Armenia, which was
called after their own name, Sacasene. They advanced even
as far as the Cappadocians, those particularly situated near
the Euxine; who are now called Pontici. When they were
assembled together and feasting on the division of the booty,
they were attacked by night by the Persian generals who
were then stationed in that quarter, and were utterly exterminated.
The Persians raised a mound of earth in the form
of a hill over a rock in the plain, (where this occurred,) and
fortified it. They erected there a temple to Ana&iuml;tis and the
gods Omanus and Anadatus, Persian deities who have a
common altar.<a name="FNanchor_997" id="FNanchor_997"></a><a href="#Footnote_997" class="fnanchor">997</a> They also instituted an annual festival, (in
memory of the event,) the Sac&aelig;a, which the occupiers of Zela,
for this is the name of the place, celebrate to this day. It is
a small city chiefly appropriated to the sacred attendants.
Pompey added to it a considerable tract of territory, the inhabitants
of which he collected within the walls. It was one
of the cities which he settled after the overthrow of Mithridates.</p>

<p>5. Such is the account which is given of the Sac&aelig; by some
writers. Others say, that Cyrus in an expedition against the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
Sac&aelig; was defeated, and fled. He advanced with his army to
the spot where he had left his stores, consisting of large supplies
of every kind, particularly of wine; he stopped a short
time to refresh his army, and set out in the evening, as
though he continued his flight, the tents being left full of provisions.
He proceeded as far as he thought requisite, and
then halted. The Sac&aelig; pursued, who, finding the camp abandoned
and full of the means of gratifying their appetites, indulged
themselves without restraint. Cyrus then returned
and found them drunk and frantic; some were killed, stretched
on the ground drowsy or asleep; others, dancing and maddened
with wine, fell defenceless on the weapons of their
enemies. Nearly all of them perished. Cyrus ascribed
this success to the gods; he consecrated the day to the goddess
worshipped in his own country, and called it Sac&aelig;a.
Wherever there is a temple of this goddess, there the Sac&aelig;an
festival, a sort of Bacchanalian feast, is celebrated, in which
both men and women, dressed in the Scythian habit, pass day
and night in drinking and wanton play.</p>

<p>6. The Massaget&aelig; signalized their bravery in the war with
Cyrus, of which many writers have published accounts; we
must get our information from them. Such particulars as
the following are narrated respecting this nation; some
tribes inhabit mountains, some plains, others live among
marshes formed by the rivers, others on the islands among the
marshes. The Araxes is said to be the river which is the chief
cause of inundating the country; it is divided into various
branches and discharges itself by many mouths into the other
sea<a name="FNanchor_998" id="FNanchor_998"></a><a href="#Footnote_998" class="fnanchor">998</a> towards the north, but by one only into the Hyrcanian
Gulf. The Massaget&aelig; regard no other deity than the sun, and
to his honour they sacrifice a horse. Each man marries only
one wife, but they have intercourse with the wives of each
other without any concealment. He who has intercourse with
the wife of another man hangs up his quiver on a waggon,
and lies with her openly. They account the best mode of
death to be chopped up when they grow old with the flesh of
sheep, and both to be devoured together. Those who die of
disease are cast out as impious, and only fit to be the prey of
wild beasts; they are excellent horsemen, and also fight well
on foot. They use bows, swords, breastplates, and sagares
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]<br />[CAS. 513]</a></span>
of brass, they wear golden belts, and turbans<a name="FNanchor_999" id="FNanchor_999"></a><a href="#Footnote_999" class="fnanchor">999</a> on their heads
in battle. Their horses have bits of gold, and golden breastplates;
they have no silver, iron in small quantity, but gold
and brass in great plenty.</p>

<p>7. Those who live in the islands have no corn-fields. Their
food consists of roots and wild fruits. Their clothes are made
of the bark of trees, for they have no sheep. They press out
and drink the juice of the fruit of certain trees.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of the marshes eat fish. They are clothed
in the skins of seals, which come upon the island from the sea.</p>

<p>The mountaineers subsist on wild fruits. They have besides
a few sheep, but they kill them sparingly, and keep
them for the sake of their wool and milk. Their clothes
they variegate by steeping them in dyes, which produce a
colour not easily effaced.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of the plains, although they possess land,
do not cultivate it, but derive their subsistence from their
fiocks, and from fish, after the manner of the nomades and
Scythians. I have frequently described a certain way of life
common to all these people. Their burial-places and their
manners are alike, and their whole manner of living is independent,
but rude, savage, and hostile; in their compacts, however,
they are simple and without deceit.</p>

<p>8. The Attasii (Augasii?) and the Chorasmii belong to
the Massaget&aelig; and Sac&aelig;, to whom Spitamenes directed his
flight from Bactria and Sogdiana. He was one of the Persians
who, like Bessus, made his escape from Alexander by
flight, as Arsaces afterwards fled from Seleucus Callinicus,
and retreated among the Aspasiac&aelig;.</p>

<p>Eratosthenes says, that the Bactrians lie along the Arachoti
and Massaget&aelig; on the west near the Oxus, and that Sac&aelig; and
Sogdiani, through the whole extent of their territory,<a name="FNanchor_1000" id="FNanchor_1000"></a><a href="#Footnote_1000" class="fnanchor">1000</a> are opposite
to India, but the Bactrii in part only, for the greater part
of their country lies parallel to the Parapomisus; that the
Sac&aelig; and Sogdiani are separated by the Iaxartes, and the
Sogdiani and Bactriani by the Oxus; that Tapyri occupy
the country between Hyrcani and Arii; that around the
shores of the sea, next to the Hyrcani, are Amardi, Anariac&aelig;,
Cadusii, Albani, Caspii, Vitii, and perhaps other tribes extending
as far as the Scythians; that on the other side of the</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span></p>

<p>Hyrcani are Derbices, that the Caducii are contiguous both to
the Medes and Matiani below the Parachoathras.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX.</h3>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Parthia</span> is not an extensive tract of country; for this
reason it was united with the Hyrcani for the purpose of paying
tribute under the Persian dominion and afterwards, during
a long period when the Macedonians were masters of the country.
Besides its small extent, it is thickly wooded, mountainous,
and produces nothing; so that the kings with their
multitude of followers pass with great speed through the
country, which is unable to furnish subsistence for such numbers
even for a short time. At present it is augmented in
extent. Comisene<a name="FNanchor_1008" id="FNanchor_1008"></a><a href="#Footnote_1008" class="fnanchor">1008</a> and Chorene are parts of Parthiene, and
perhaps also the country as far as the Caspian Gates, Rhag&aelig;,
and the Tapyri, which formerly belonged to Media. Apameia
and Heracleia are cities in the neighbourhood of Rhag&aelig;.</p>

<p>From the Caspian Gates to Rhag&aelig; are 500 stadia according
to Apollodorus, and to Hecatompylos, the royal seat of
the Parthians, 1260 stadia. Rhag&aelig;<a name="FNanchor_1009" id="FNanchor_1009"></a><a href="#Footnote_1009" class="fnanchor">1009</a> is said to have had its
name from the earthquakes which occurred in that country, by
which many cities and two thousand villages, as Poseidonius
relates, were overthrown. The Tapyri are said to live between
the Derbices and the Hyrcani. Historians say, that
it is a custom among the Tapyri to surrender the married
women to other men, even when the husbands have had two
or three children by them, as Cato surrendered Marcia in
our times, according to an ancient custom of the Romans, to
Hortensius, at his request.</p>

<p>2. Disturbances having arisen in the countries beyond the
Taurus in consequence of the kings of Syria and Media,
who possessed the tract of which we are speaking, being engaged
in other affairs,<a name="FNanchor_1010" id="FNanchor_1010"></a><a href="#Footnote_1010" class="fnanchor">1010</a> those who were intrusted with the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
government of it occasioned first the revolt of Bactriana;
then Euthydemus and his party the revolt of all the country
near that province. Afterwards Arsaces, a Scythian, (with
the Parni, called nomades, a tribe of the Dah&aelig;, who live on
the banks of the Ochus,) invaded Parthia, and made himself
master of it. At first both Arsaces and his successors were
weakened by maintaining wars with those who had been deprived
of their territory. Afterwards they became so powerful,
in consequence of their successful warfare, continually depriving
their neighbours of portions of their territory, that at last
they took possession of all the country within the Euphrates.
They deprived Eucratidas, and then the Scythians, by force
of arms, of a part of Bactriana. They now have an empire
comprehending so large an extent of country, and so many
nations, that it almost rivals that of the Romans in magnitude.
This is to be attributed to their mode of life and manners,
which have indeed much of the barbarous and Scythian character,
but are very well adapted for establishing dominion,
and for insuring success in war.</p>

<p>3. They say that the Dah&aelig; Parni were an emigrant tribe
from the Dah&aelig; above the M&aelig;otis, who are called Xandii
and Parii. But it is not generally acknowledged that Dah&aelig;
are to be found among the Scythians above the M&aelig;otis, yet
from these Arsaces according to some was descended; according
to others he was a Bactrian, and withdrawing himself
from the increasing power of Diodotus, occasioned the
revolt of Parthia.</p>

<p>We have enlarged on the subject of the Parthian customs
in the sixth book of historical commentaries, and in the second
of those, which are a sequel to Polybius: we shall omit what
we said, in order to avoid repetition; adding this only, that
Poseidonius affirms that the council of the Parthians is composed
of two classes, one of relatives, (of the royal family,)
and another of wise men and magi, by both of which kings
are chosen.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER X.</h3>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Aria</span> and Margiana, which are the best districts in this
portion of Asia, are partly composed of valleys enclosed by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]<br />[CAS. 516]</a></span>
mountains, and partly of inhabited plains. Some tribes of Scenit&aelig;
(dwellers in tents) occupy the mountains; the plains are
watered by the rivers Arius and by the Margus.</p>

<p>Aria borders upon Bactriana, and the mountain<a name="FNanchor_1011" id="FNanchor_1011"></a><a href="#Footnote_1011" class="fnanchor">1011</a> which has
Bactriana at its foot. It is distant from [the] Hyrcania[n
sea] about 6000 stadia.</p>

<p>Drangiana as far as Carmania furnished jointly with Aria
payment of the tribute. The greater part of this country
is situated at the foot of the southern side of the mountains;
some tracts however approach the northern side opposite Aria.</p>

<p>Arachosia, which belongs to the territory of Aria, is not far
distant; it lies at the foot of the southern side of the mountains,
and extends to the river Indus.</p>

<p>The length of Aria is about 2000 stadia, and the breadth
of the plain 300 stadia. Its cities are Artaca&euml;na, Alexandreia,
and Acha&iuml;a, which are called after the names of their founders.</p>

<p>The soil produces excellent wines, which may be kept for
three generations in unpitched vessels.</p>

<p>2. Margiana is like this country, but the plain is surrounded
by deserts. Antiochus Soter admired its fertility; he
enclosed a circle of 1500 stadia with a wall, and founded a
city, Antiocheia. The soil is well adapted to vines. They
say that a vine stem has been frequently seen there which
would require two men to girth it, and bunches of grapes
two cubits in size.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER XI.</h3>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Some</span> parts of Bactria lie along Aria to the north,
but the greater part stretches beyond (Aria) to the east. It
is an extensive country, and produces everything except oil.</p>

<p>The Greeks who occasioned its revolt became so powerful
by means of the fertility and advantages of the country, that
they became masters of Ariana and India, according to
Apollodorus of Artamita. Their chiefs, particularly Menander,
(if he really crossed the Hypanis to the east and reached
Isamus,)<a name="FNanchor_1012" id="FNanchor_1012"></a><a href="#Footnote_1012" class="fnanchor">1012</a> conquered more nations than Alexander. These
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
conquests were achieved partly by Menander, partly by Demetrius,
son of Euthydemus, king of the Bactrians. They
got possession not only of Pattalene,<a name="FNanchor_1013" id="FNanchor_1013"></a><a href="#Footnote_1013" class="fnanchor">1013</a> but of the kingdoms of
Saraostus, and Sigerdis, which constitute the remainder of the
coast. Apollodorus in short says that Bactriana is the ornament
of all Ariana. They extended their empire even as far
as the Seres and Phryni.</p>

<p>2. Their cities were Bactra, which they call also Zariaspa,
(a river of the same name flows through it, and empties itself
into the Oxus,) and Darapsa,<a name="FNanchor_1014" id="FNanchor_1014"></a><a href="#Footnote_1014" class="fnanchor">1014</a> and many others. Among
these was Eucratidia, which had its name from Eucratidas,
the king. When the Greeks got possession of the country,
they divided it into satrapies; that of Aspionus and Turiva<a name="FNanchor_1015" id="FNanchor_1015"></a><a href="#Footnote_1015" class="fnanchor">1015</a>
the Parthians took from Eucratidas. They possessed Sogdiana
also, situated above Bactriana to the east, between the
river Oxus (which bounds Bactriana and Sogdiana) and the
Iaxartes; the latter river separates the Sogdii and the
nomades.</p>

<p>3. Anciently the Sogdiani and Bactriani did not differ
much from the nomades in their mode of life and manners,
yet the manners of the Bactriani were a little more civilized.
Onesicritus however does not give the most favourable account
of this people. Those who are disabled by disease or old age
are thrown alive to be devoured by dogs kept expressly for
this purpose, and whom in the language of the country they
call entombers.<a name="FNanchor_1016" id="FNanchor_1016"></a><a href="#Footnote_1016" class="fnanchor">1016</a> The places on the exterior of the walls of
the capital of the Bactrians are clean, but the interior is for
the most part full of human bones. Alexander abolished this
custom. Something of the same kind is related of the Caspii
also, who, when their parents have attained the age of 70
years, confine them, and let them die of hunger. This custom,
although Scythian in character, is more tolerable than
that of the Bactrians, and is similar to the domestic law of
the Cei;<a name="FNanchor_1017" id="FNanchor_1017"></a><a href="#Footnote_1017" class="fnanchor">1017</a> the custom however of the Bactrians is much more
according to Scythian manners. We may be justly at a loss
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]<br />[CAS. 517]</a></span>
to conjecture,<a name="FNanchor_1018" id="FNanchor_1018"></a><a href="#Footnote_1018" class="fnanchor">1018</a> if Alexander found such customs prevailing
there, what were the customs which probably were observed
by them in the time of the first kings of Persia, and of the
princes who preceded them.</p>

<p>4. Alexander, it is said, founded eight cities in Bactriana
and Sogdiana; some he razed, among which were Cariat&aelig; in
Bactriana, where Callisthenes was seized and imprisoned;
Maracanda in Sogdiana, and Cyra, the last of the places
founded by Cyrus, situated upon the river Iaxartes, and the
boundary of the Persian empire. This also, although it was
attached to Cyrus, he razed on account of its frequent revolts.</p>

<p>Alexander took also, it is said, by means of treachery, strong
fortified rocks; one of which belonged to Sisimithres in Bactriana,
where Oxyartes kept his daughter Roxana; another to
Oxus in Sogdiana, or, according to some writers, to Ariamazas.
The stronghold of Sisimithres is described by historians
to have been fifteen stadia in height, and eighty stadia
in circuit. On the summit is a level ground, which is fertile
and capable of maintaining 500 men. Here Alexander was
entertained with sumptuous hospitality, and here he espoused
Roxana the daughter of Oxyartes. The height of the fortress
in Sogdiana is double the height of this. It was near these
places that he destroyed the city of the Branchid&aelig;, whom
Xerxes settled there, and who had voluntarily accompanied him
from their own country. They had delivered up to the Persians
the riches of the god at Didymi, and the treasure there
deposited. Alexander destroyed their city in abhorrence of
their treachery and sacrilege.</p>

<p>5. Aristobulus calls the river, which runs through Sogdiana,
Polytimetus, a name imposed by the Macedonians, as
they imposed many others, some of which were altogether
new, others were deflections<a name="FNanchor_1019" id="FNanchor_1019"></a><a href="#Footnote_1019" class="fnanchor">1019</a> from the native appellations.
This river after watering the country flows through a desert
and sandy soil, and is absorbed in the sand, like the Arius,
which flows through the territory of the Arii.</p>

<p>It is said that on digging near the river Ochus a spring of
oil was discovered. It is probable, that as certain nitrous, astringent,
bituminous, and sulphurous fluids permeate the
earth, greasy fluids may be found, but the rarity of their occurrence
makes their existence almost doubtful.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span></p>

<p>The course of the Ochus, according to some writers, is
through Bactriana, according to others parallel to it. Some
allege that, taking a more southerly direction, it is distinct
from the Oxus to its mouths, but that they both discharge
themselves (separately) into the Caspian in Hyrcania. Others
again say that it is distinct, at its commencement, from the
Oxus, but that it (afterwards) unites with the latter river,
having in many places a breadth of six or seven stadia.</p>

<p>The Iaxartes is distinct from the Oxus from its commencement
to its termination, and empties itself into the same sea.
Their mouths, according to Patrocles, are about 80 parasangs
distant from each other. The Persian parasang some say
contains 60, others 30 or 40, stadia.</p>

<p>When I was sailing up the Nile, sch&#339;ni of different measures
were used in passing from one city to another, so that
the same number of schoeni gave in some places a longer, in
others a shorter, length to the voyage. This mode of computation
has been handed down from an early period, and is
continued to the present time.</p>

<p>6. In proceeding from Hyrcania towards the rising sun as
far as Sogdiana, the nations beyond (within?) the Taurus
were known first to the Persians, and afterwards to the Macedonians
and Parthians. The nations lying in a straight line<a name="FNanchor_1020" id="FNanchor_1020"></a><a href="#Footnote_1020" class="fnanchor">1020</a>
above these people are supposed to be Scythian, from their
resemblance to that nation. But we are not acquainted with
any expeditions which have been undertaken against them,
nor against the most northerly tribes of the nomades. Alexander
proposed to conduct his army against them, when he
was in pursuit of Bessus and Spitamenes, but when Bessus was
taken prisoner, and Spitamenes put to death by the Barbarians,
he desisted from executing his intention.</p>

<p>It is not generally admitted, that persons have passed
round by sea from India to Hyrcania, but Patrocles asserts
that it may be done.</p>

<p>7. It is said that the termination of Taurus, which is called
Imaus, approaches close to the Indian Sea, and neither advances
towards nor recedes from the East more than India
itself. But on passing to the northern side, the sea contracts
(throughout the whole coast) the length and breadth of India,
so as to shorten on the East the portion of Asia we are now
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]<br />[CAS. 519]</a></span>
describing, comprehended between the Taurus and the Northern
Ocean, which forms the Caspian Sea.</p>

<p>The greatest length of this portion, reckoned from the Hyrcanian
Sea to the (Eastern) Ocean opposite Imaus, is about
30,000 stadia,<a name="FNanchor_1021" id="FNanchor_1021"></a><a href="#Footnote_1021" class="fnanchor">1021</a> the route being along the mountainous tract of
Taurus; the breadth is less than 10,000 stadia.<a name="FNanchor_1022" id="FNanchor_1022"></a><a href="#Footnote_1022" class="fnanchor">1022</a> We have
said before, that<a name="FNanchor_1023" id="FNanchor_1023"></a><a href="#Footnote_1023" class="fnanchor">1023</a> from the bay of Issus to the eastern sea along
the coast of India is about 40,000 stadia, and to Issus from
the western extremities at the pillars 30,000 stadia. The
recess of the bay of Issus is little, if at all, more to the east
than Amisus; from Amisus to Hyrcania is about 10,000
stadia in a line parallel to that which we have described as
drawn from the bay of Issus to India. There remains therefore
for the portion now delineated the above-mentioned
length towards the east, namely, 30,000 stadia.<a name="FNanchor_1024" id="FNanchor_1024"></a><a href="#Footnote_1024" class="fnanchor">1024</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span></p>

<p>Again, since the breadth of the longest part of the habitable
earth, which has the shape of a chlamys, (or a military cloak,)
is about 30,000 stadia, this distance would be near the meridian
line drawn through the Hyrcanian and the Persian
Seas, for the length of the habitable earth is 70,000 stadia.
If therefore from Hyrcania to Artemita<a name="FNanchor_1025" id="FNanchor_1025"></a><a href="#Footnote_1025" class="fnanchor">1025</a> in Babylonia are
8000 stadia according to Apollodorus of Artemita, and thence
to the mouth of the Persian Sea 8000, and again 8000, or a
little short of that number, to the places on the same parallel
with the extremities of &AElig;thiopia, there would remain, to
complete the breadth as I have described it, of the habitable
earth, the number of stadia<a name="FNanchor_1026" id="FNanchor_1026"></a><a href="#Footnote_1026" class="fnanchor">1026</a> which I have mentioned, reckoning
from the recess of the Hyrcanian Sea to its mouth. This
segment of the earth being truncated towards the eastern
parts, its figure would resemble a cook&#8217;s knife, for the mountainous
range being prolonged in a straight line, answers to
the edge, while the shape of the coast from the mouth of the
Hyrcanian Sea to Tamarus on the other side terminates in a
circular truncated line.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]<br />[CAS. 519]</a></span></p>

<p>8. We must mention some of the extraordinary circumstances
which are related of those tribes which are perfectly
barbarous, living about Mount Caucasus, and the other mountainous
districts.</p>

<p>What Euripides expresses in the following lines is said to
be a custom among them;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;they lament the birth of the new-born on account of the many evils to
which they are exposed; but the dead, and one at rest from his troubles,
is carried forth from his home with joy and gratulation.&#8221;</p>

<p>Other tribes do not put to death even the greatest offenders,
but only banish them from their territories together with
their children; which is contrary to the custom of the Derbices,
who punish even slight offences with death. The Derbices
worship the earth. They neither sacrifice, nor eat the
female of any animal. Persons who attain the age of above
seventy years are put to death by them, and their nearest relations
eat their flesh. Old women are strangled, and then
buried. Those who die under seventy years of age are not
eaten, but are only buried.</p>

<p>The Siginni in general practise Persian customs. They
have small horses with shaggy hair, but which are not able
to carry a rider. Four of these horses are harnessed together,
driven by women, who are trained to this employment from
childhood. The best driver marries whom she pleases. Some,
they say, make it their study to appear with heads as long as
possible, and with foreheads projecting over their chins.</p>

<p>The Tapyrii have a custom for the men to dress in black,
and wear their hair long, and the women to dress in white,
and wear their hair short. [They live between the Derbices
and Hyrcani.]<a name="FNanchor_1027" id="FNanchor_1027"></a><a href="#Footnote_1027" class="fnanchor">1027</a> He who is esteemed the bravest marries
whom he likes.</p>

<p>The Caspii starve to death those who are above seventy
years old, by exposing them in a desert place. The exposed
are observed at a distance; if they are dragged from their
resting-place by birds, they are then pronounced happy; but
if by wild beasts, or dogs, less fortunate; but if by none of
these, ill-fated.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XII.</h3>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Since</span> the Taurus constitutes the northern parts of Asia,
which are called also the parts within the Taurus, I propose
to speak first of these.</p>

<p>They are situated either entirely, or chiefly, among the
mountains. Those to the east of the Caspian Gates admit of
a shorter description on account of the rude state of the people,
nor is there much difference whether they are referred to
one climate<a name="FNanchor_1028" id="FNanchor_1028"></a><a href="#Footnote_1028" class="fnanchor">1028</a> or the other. All the western countries furnish
abundant matter for description. We must therefore proceed
to the places situated near the Caspian Gates.</p>

<p>Media lies towards the west, an extensive country, and
formerly powerful; it is situated in the middle of Taurus,
which here has many branches, and contains large valleys, as
is the case in Armenia.</p>

<p>2. This mountain has its beginning in Caria and Lycia,
but does not exhibit there either considerable breadth or
height. It first appears to have a great altitude opposite the
Chelidone&aelig;,<a name="FNanchor_1029" id="FNanchor_1029"></a><a href="#Footnote_1029" class="fnanchor">1029</a> which are islands situated in front of the commencement
of the Pamphylian coast. It extends towards
the east, and includes the long valleys of Cilicia. Then on
one side the Amanus<a name="FNanchor_1030" id="FNanchor_1030"></a><a href="#Footnote_1030" class="fnanchor">1030</a> is detached from it, and on the other
the Anti-Taurus.<a name="FNanchor_1031" id="FNanchor_1031"></a><a href="#Footnote_1031" class="fnanchor">1031</a> In the latter is situated Comana,<a name="FNanchor_1032" id="FNanchor_1032"></a><a href="#Footnote_1032" class="fnanchor">1032</a> belonging
to the Upper Cappadocia. It terminates in Cataonia,
but Mount Amanus is continued as far as the Euphrates, and
Melitene,<a name="FNanchor_1033" id="FNanchor_1033"></a><a href="#Footnote_1033" class="fnanchor">1033</a> where Commagene extends along Cappadocia.
It receives the mountains beyond the Euphrates, which are
continuous with those before mentioned, except the part which
is intercepted by the river flowing through the middle of them.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]<br />[CAS. 521]</a></span>
Here its height and breadth become greater, and its branches
more numerous. The Taurus extends the farthest distance
towards the south, where it separates Armenia from Mesopotamia.</p>

<p>3. From the south flow both rivers, the Euphrates and
the Tigris, which encircle Mesopotamia, and approach close
to each other at Babylonia, and then discharge themselves
into the sea on the coast of Persia. The Euphrates is the
larger river, and traverses a greater tract of country with a tortuous
course, it rises in the northern part of Taurus, and flows
toward the west through Armenia the Greater, as it is called,
to Armenia the Less, having the latter on the right and
Acilisene on the left hand. It then turns to the south, and
at its bend touches the boundaries of Cappadocia. It leaves
this and Commagene on the right hand; on the left Acilisene
and Sophene,<a name="FNanchor_1034" id="FNanchor_1034"></a><a href="#Footnote_1034" class="fnanchor">1034</a> belonging to the Greater Armenia. It
proceeds onwards to Syria, and again makes another bend in
its way to Babylonia and the Persian Gulf.</p>

<p>The Tigris takes its course from the southern part of the
same mountains to Seleucia,<a name="FNanchor_1035" id="FNanchor_1035"></a><a href="#Footnote_1035" class="fnanchor">1035</a> approaches close to the Euphrates,
with which it forms Mesopotamia. It then empties
itself into the same gulf.</p>

<p>The sources of the Tigris and of the Euphrates are distant
from each other about 2500 stadia.</p>

<p>4. Towards the north there are many forks which branch
away from the Taurus. One of these is called Anti-Taurus,
for there the mountain had this name, and includes Sophene
in a valley situated between Anti-Taurus and the Taurus.</p>

<p>Next to the Anti-Taurus on the other side of the Euphrates,
along the Lesser Armenia, there stretches towards the north
a large mountain with many branches, one of which is called
Paryadres,<a name="FNanchor_1036" id="FNanchor_1036"></a><a href="#Footnote_1036" class="fnanchor">1036</a> another the Moschic mountains, and others by
other names. The Moschic mountains comprehend the whole
of Armenians as far as the Iberians and Albanians. Other
mountains again rise towards the east above the Caspian Sea,
and extend as far as Media the Greater, and the Atropatian-Media.
They call all these parts of the mountains Parachoathras,
as well as those which extend to the Caspian Gates, and
those still farther above towards the east, which are contiguous
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
to Asia. The following are the names of the mountains
towards the north.</p>

<p>The southern mountains on the other side of the Euphrates,
extending towards the east from Cappadocia and Commagene,<a name="FNanchor_1037" id="FNanchor_1037"></a><a href="#Footnote_1037" class="fnanchor">1037</a>
at their commencement have the name of Taurus, which
separates Sophene and the rest of Armenia from Mesopotamia,
but some writers call them the Gordy&aelig;an mountains.<a name="FNanchor_1038" id="FNanchor_1038"></a><a href="#Footnote_1038" class="fnanchor">1038</a>
Among these is Mount Masius,<a name="FNanchor_1039" id="FNanchor_1039"></a><a href="#Footnote_1039" class="fnanchor">1039</a> which is situated above Nisibis,<a name="FNanchor_1040" id="FNanchor_1040"></a><a href="#Footnote_1040" class="fnanchor">1040</a>
and Tigranocerta.<a name="FNanchor_1041" id="FNanchor_1041"></a><a href="#Footnote_1041" class="fnanchor">1041</a> It then becomes more elevated, and
is called Niphates.<a name="FNanchor_1042" id="FNanchor_1042"></a><a href="#Footnote_1042" class="fnanchor">1042</a> Somewhere in this part on the southern
side of the mountainous chain are the sources of the Tigris.
Then the ridge of mountains continuing to extend from the
Niphates forms the mountain Zagrius, which separates Media
and Babylonia. After the Zagrius follows above Babylonia
the mountainous range of the Elym&aelig;i and Par&aelig;taceni, and
above Media that of the Coss&aelig;i.</p>

<p>In the middle of these branches are situated Media and
Armenia, which comprise many mountains, and many mountain
plains, as well as plains and large valleys. Numerous
small tribes live around among the mountains, who are for
the most part robbers.</p>

<p>We thus place within the Taurus Armenia and Media, to
which belong the Caspian Gates.</p>

<p>5. In our opinion these nations may be considered as situated
to the north, since they are within the Taurus. But
Eratosthenes, having divided Asia into southern and northern
portions, and what he calls seals, (or sections,)<a name="FNanchor_1043" id="FNanchor_1043"></a><a href="#Footnote_1043" class="fnanchor">1043</a> designating
some as northern, others as southern, makes the Caspian
Gates the boundary of both climates. He might without any
impropriety have represented the more southern parts of the
Caspian Gates as in southern Asia, among which are Media
and Armenia, and the parts more to the north than the Caspian
Gates in northern Asia, which might be the case according
to different descriptions of the country. But perhaps
Eratosthenes did not attend to the circumstance, that there
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]<br />[CAS. 523]</a></span>
is no part of Armenia nor of Media towards the south on the
other side of the Taurus.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER XIII.</h3>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Media</span> is divided into two parts, one of which is called
the Greater Media. Its capital is Ecbatana,<a name="FNanchor_1044" id="FNanchor_1044"></a><a href="#Footnote_1044" class="fnanchor">1044</a> a large city
containing the royal seat of the Median empire. This palace
the Parthians continue to occupy even at this time. Here
their kings pass the summer, for the air of Media is cool.
Their winter residence is at Seleucia, on the Tigris, near
Babylon.</p>

<p>The other division is Atropatian Media. It had its name
from Atropatus, a chief who prevented this country, which is
a part of Greater Media, from being subjected to the dominion
of the Macedonians. When he was made king he
established the independence of this country; his successors
continue to the present day, and have at different times contracted
marriages with the kings of Armenia, Syria, and
Parthia.</p>

<p>2. Atropatian Media borders upon Armenia and Matiane<a name="FNanchor_1045" id="FNanchor_1045"></a><a href="#Footnote_1045" class="fnanchor">1045</a>
towards the east, towards the west on the Greater Media, and
on both towards the north; towards the south it is contiguous
to the people living about the recess of the Hyrcanian Sea,
and to Matiane.</p>

<p>According to Apollonides its strength is not inconsiderable,
since it can furnish 10,000 cavalry and 40,000 infantry.</p>

<p>It contains a lake called Spauta,<a name="FNanchor_1046" id="FNanchor_1046"></a><a href="#Footnote_1046" class="fnanchor">1046</a> (Kapauta,) in which salt
effloresces, and is consolidated. The salt occasions itching and
pain, but oil is a cure for both, and sweet water restores the
colour of clothes, which have the appearance of being burnt,<a name="FNanchor_1047" id="FNanchor_1047"></a><a href="#Footnote_1047" class="fnanchor">1047</a>
when they have been immersed in the lake by ignorant persons
for the purpose of washing them.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span></p>

<p>They have powerful neighbours in the Armenians and
Parthians, by whom they are frequently plundered; they resist
however, and recover what has been taken away, as they
recovered Symbace<a name="FNanchor_1048" id="FNanchor_1048"></a><a href="#Footnote_1048" class="fnanchor">1048</a> from the Armenians, who were defeated
by the Romans, and they themselves became the friends of
C&aelig;sar. They at the same time endeavour to conciliate the
Parthians.</p>

<p>3. The summer palace is at Gazaka, situated in a plain;
the winter palace<a name="FNanchor_1049" id="FNanchor_1049"></a><a href="#Footnote_1049" class="fnanchor">1049</a> is in Vera, a strong fortress which Antony
besieged in his expedition against the Parthians. The last
is distant from the Araxes, which separates Armenia and
Atropatene, 2400 stadia, according to Dellius, the friend of
Antony, who wrote an account of the expedition of Antony
against the Parthians, which he himself accompanied, and in
which he held a command.</p>

<p>The other parts of this country are fertile, but that towards
the north is mountainous, rugged, and cold, the abode of the
mountain tribes of Cadusii, Amardi, Tapyri, Curtii, and other
similar nations, who are migratory, and robbers. These people
are scattered over the Zagrus and Niphates. The Curtii
in Persia, and Mardi, (for so they call the Amardi,) and
those in Armenia, and who bear the same name at present,
have the same kind of character.</p>

<p>4. The Cadusii have an army of foot soldiers not inferior
in number to that of the Ariani. They are very expert in
throwing the javelin. In the rocky places the soldiers engage
in battle on foot, instead of on their horses. The expedition
of Antony was harassing to the army, not by the
nature of the country, but by the conduct of their guide,
Artavasdes, king of the Armenii, whom Antony rashly made
his adviser, and master of his intentions respecting the war,
when at the same time that prince was contriving a plan for
his destruction. Antony punished Artavasdes, but too late;
the latter had been the cause of many calamities to the
Romans, in conjunction with another person; he made the
march from the Zeugma on the Euphrates to the borders of
Atropatene to exceed 8000 stadia, or double the distance of
the direct course, [by leading the army] over mountains, and
places where there were no roads, and by a circuitous route.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]<br />[CAS. 524]</a></span></p>

<p>5. The Greater Media anciently governed the whole of
Asia, after the overthrow of the Syrian empire: but afterwards,
in the time of Astyages, the Medes were deprived of
this extensive sovereignty by Cyrus and the Persians, yet
they retained much of their ancient importance. Ecbatana
was the winter (royal?) residence<a name="FNanchor_1050" id="FNanchor_1050"></a><a href="#Footnote_1050" class="fnanchor">1050</a> of the Persian kings, as it
was of the Macedonian princes, who overthrew the Persian
empire, and got possession of Syria. It still continues to
serve the same purpose, and affords security to the kings of
Parthia.</p>

<p>6. Media is bounded on the east by Parthia, and by the
mountains of the Coss&aelig;i, a predatory tribe. They once furnished
the Elym&aelig;i, whose allies they were in the war against
the Susii and Babylonians, with 13,000 archers. Nearchus
says that there were four robber tribes; the Mardi, who were
contiguous to the Persians; the Uxii and Elym&aelig;i, who were
on the borders of the Persians and Susii; and the Coss&aelig;i, on
those of the Medes; that all of them exacted tribute from the
kings; that the Coss&aelig;i received presents, when the king, having
passed his summer at Ecbatana went down to Babylonia;
that Alexander attacked them in the winter time, and repressed
their excessive insolence. Media is bounded on the
east by these nations, and by the Par&aelig;taceni, who are contiguous
to the Persians, and are mountaineers, and robbers;
on the north by the Cadusii, who live above the Hyrcanian
Sea, and by other nations, whom we have just enumerated;
on the south by the Apolloniatis, which the ancients called
Sitacene, and by the Zagrus, along which lies Massabatica,
which belongs to Media, but according to others, to Elym&aelig;a;
on the west by the Atropatii, and by some tribes of the Armenians.</p>

<p>There are also Grecian cities in Media, founded by Macedonians,
as Laodiceia, Apameia, Heracleia near Rhag&aelig;, and
Rhaga itself, founded by Nicator, who called it Europus, and
the Parthians Arsacia, situated about 500 stadia to the south
of the Caspian Gates, according to Apollodorus of Artemita.</p>

<p>7. The greater part of Media consists of high ground, and is
cold; such are the mountains above Ecbatana, and the places
about Rhag&aelig; and the Caspian Gates, and the northern parts
in general extending thence as far as Matiane and Armenia.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
The country below the Caspian Gates consists of flat grounds
and valleys. It is very fertile, and produces everything except
the olive, or if it grows anywhere it does not yield oil, and is
dry. The country is peculiarly adapted, as well as Armenia,
for breeding horses. There is a meadow tract called Hippobotus,
which is traversed by travellers on their way from
Persia and Babylonia to the Caspian Gates. Here, it is said,
fifty thousand mares were pastured in the time of the Persians,
and were the king&#8217;s stud. The Nes&aelig;an horses, the
best and largest in the king&#8217;s province, were of this breed,
according to some writers, but according to others they came
from Armenia. Their shape is peculiar, as is that of the Parthian
horses, compared with those of Greece and others in our
country.</p>

<p>The herbage which constitutes the chief food of the horses
we call peculiarly by the name of Medic, from its growing in
Media in great abundance. The country produces Silphium,<a name="FNanchor_1051" id="FNanchor_1051"></a><a href="#Footnote_1051" class="fnanchor">1051</a>
from which is obtained the Medic juice, much inferior to the
Cyrenaic, but sometimes it excels the latter, which may be
accounted for by the difference of places, or from a change
the plant may undergo, or from the mode of extracting and
preparing the juice so as to continue good when laid by
for use.</p>

<p>8. Such then is the nature of the country with respect to
magnitude; its length and breadth are nearly equal. The
greatest breadth (length?)<a name="FNanchor_1052" id="FNanchor_1052"></a><a href="#Footnote_1052" class="fnanchor">1052</a> however seems to be that reckoned
from the pass across the Zagrus, which is called the Median
Gate, to the Caspian Gates, through the country of Sigriana,
4100 stadia.</p>

<p>The account of the tribute paid agrees with the extent and
wealth of the country. Cappadocia paid to the Persians
yearly, in addition to a tribute in silver, 1500 horses, 2000
mules, and 50,000 sheep, and the Medes contributed nearly
double this amount.</p>

<p>9. Many of their customs are the same as those of the Armenians,
from the similarity of the countries which they inhabit.
The Medes however were the first to communicate
them to the Armenians, and still before that time to the Persians,
who were their masters, and successors in the empire
of Asia.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]<br />[CAS. 526]</a></span></p>

<p>The Persian stole, as it is now called, the pursuit of archery
and horsemanship, the court paid to their kings, their attire,
and veneration fitting for gods paid by the subjects to the
prince,&mdash;these the Persians derived from the Medes. That
this is the fact appears chiefly from their dress. A tiara, a
citaris, a hat,<a name="FNanchor_1053" id="FNanchor_1053"></a><a href="#Footnote_1053" class="fnanchor">1053</a> tunics with sleeves reaching to the hands, and
trowsers, are proper to be worn in cold and northerly places,
such as those in Media, but they are not by any means adapted
to inhabitants of the south. The Persians had their
principal settlements on the Gulf of Persia, being situated
more to the south than the Babylonians and the Susii. But
after the overthrow of the Medes they gained possession of
some tracts of country contiguous to Media. The custom
however of the vanquished appeared to the conquerors to be
so noble, and appropriate to royal state, that instead of nakedness
or scanty clothing, they endured the use of the feminine
stole, and were entirely covered with dress to the feet.</p>

<p>10. Some writers say that Medeia, when with Jason she
ruled in these countries, introduced this kind of dress, and
concealed her countenance as often as she appeared in public
in place of the king; that the memorials of Jason are, the
Jasonian heroa,<a name="FNanchor_1054" id="FNanchor_1054"></a><a href="#Footnote_1054" class="fnanchor">1054</a> held in great reverence by the Barbarians,
(besides a great mountain above the Caspian Gates on the
left hand, called Jasonium,) and that the memorials of Medeia
are the kind of dress, and the name of the country. Medus, her
son, is said to have been her successor in the kingdom, and
the country to have been called after his name. In agreement
with this are the Jasonia in Armenia, the name of the country,
and many other circumstances which we shall mention.</p>

<p>11. It is a Median custom to elect the bravest person as
king, but this does not generally prevail, being confined to
the mountain tribes. The custom for the kings to have many
wives is more general, it is found among all the mountaineers
also, but they are not permitted to have less than five. In the
same manner the women think it honourable for husbands to
have as many wives as possible, and esteem it a misfortune if
they have less than five.</p>

<p>While the rest of Media is very fertile, the northern and
mountainous part is barren. The people subsist upon the
produce of trees. They make cakes of apples, sliced and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
dried, and bread of roasted almonds; they express a wine
from some kind of roots. They eat the flesh of wild animals,
and do not breed any tame animals. So much then respecting
the Medes. As to the laws and customs in common use
throughout the whole of Media, as they are the same as those
of the Persians in consequence of the establishment of the
Persian empire, I shall speak of them when I give an account
of the latter nation.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER XIV.</h3>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">The</span> southern parts of Armenia lie in front of the Taurus,
which separates Armenia from the whole of the country
situated between the Euphrates and the Tigris, and which is
called Mesopotamia. The eastern parts are contiguous to
the Greater Media, and to Atropatene. To the north are the
range of the mountains of Parachoathras lying above the
Caspian Sea, the Albanians, Iberians, and the Caucasus. The
Caucasus encircles these nations, and approaches close to the
Armenians, the Moschic and Colchic mountains, and extends
as far as the country of the people called Tibareni. On
the west are these nations and the mountains Paryadres and
Scydises, extending to the Lesser Armenia, and the country
on the side of the Euphrates, which divides Armenia from
Cappadocia and Commagene.</p>

<p>2. The Euphrates rises in the northern side of the Taurus,
and flows at first towards the west through Armenia, it
then makes a bend to the south, and intersects the Taurus
between the Armenians, Cappadocians, and Commageni.
Then issuing outwards and entering Syria, it turns towards
the winter sunrise as far as Babylon, and forms Mesopotamia
with the Tigris. Both these rivers terminate in the Persian
Gulf.</p>

<p>Such is the nature of the places around Armenia, almost
all of them mountainous and rugged, except a few tracts
which verge towards Media.</p>

<p>To the above-mentioned Taurus, which commences again
in the country on the other side of the Euphrates, occupied
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]<br />[CAS. 527]</a></span>
by the Commageni, and Meliteni formed by the Euphrates,
belongs Mount Masius, which is situated on the south above
the Mygdones in Mesopotamia, in whose territory is Nisibis;
on the northern parts is Sophene, lying between the Masius
and Anti-Taurus. Anti-Taurus begins from the Euphrates and
the Taurus, and terminates at the eastern parts of Armenia,
enclosing within it Sophene. It has on the other side Acilisene,
which lies between [Anti-]Taurus and the bed of the
Euphrates before it turns to the south. The royal city of
Sophene is Carcathiocerta.<a name="FNanchor_1055" id="FNanchor_1055"></a><a href="#Footnote_1055" class="fnanchor">1055</a></p>

<p>Above Mount Masius far to the east along Gordyene is the
Niphates, then the Abus,<a name="FNanchor_1056" id="FNanchor_1056"></a><a href="#Footnote_1056" class="fnanchor">1056</a> from which flow both the Euphrates
and the Araxes, the former to the west, the latter to the east;
then the Nibarus, which extends as far as Media.</p>

<p>3. We have described the course of the Euphrates. The
Araxes, after running to the east as far as Atropatene, makes
a bend towards the west and north. It then first flows beside
Azara, then by Artaxata,<a name="FNanchor_1057" id="FNanchor_1057"></a><a href="#Footnote_1057" class="fnanchor">1057</a> a city of the Armenians; afterwards
it passes through the plain of Araxenus to discharge itself
into the Caspian Sea.</p>

<p>4. There are many mountains in Armenia, and many
mountain plains, in which not even the vine grows. There
are also many valleys, some are moderately fertile, others
are very productive, as the Araxenian plain, through which
the river Araxes flows to the extremities of Albania, and
empties itself into the Caspian Sea. Next is Sacasene,
which borders upon Albania, and the river Cyrus; then
Gogarene. All this district abounds with products of the soil,
cultivated fruit trees and evergreens. It bears also the olive.</p>

<p>There is Phauene, (Phanen&aelig;, Phasiana?) a province of Armenia,
Comisene, and Orchistene, which furnishes large bodies
of cavalry.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span></p>

<p>Chorzene<a name="FNanchor_1058" id="FNanchor_1058"></a><a href="#Footnote_1058" class="fnanchor">1058</a> and Cambysene are the most northerly countries,
and particularly subject to falls of snow. They are contiguous
to the Caucasian mountains, to Iberia, and Colchis.
Here, they say, on the passes over mountains, it frequently
happens that whole companies of persons have been overwhelmed
in violent snow-storms. Travellers are provided
against such dangerous accidents with poles, which they force
upwards to the surface of the snow, for the purpose of breathing,
and of signifying their situation to other travellers who
may come that way, so that they may receive assistance, be
extricated, and so escape alive.</p>

<p>They say that hollow masses are consolidated in the snow,
which contain good water, enveloped as in a coat; that animals
are bred in the snow, which Apollonides call scoleces,<a name="FNanchor_1059" id="FNanchor_1059"></a><a href="#Footnote_1059" class="fnanchor">1059</a>
and Theophanes, thripes, and that these hollow masses contain
good water, which is obtained by breaking open their
coats or coverings. The generation of these animals is supposed
to be similar to that of the gnats, (or mosquitos,) from
flames, and the sparks in mines.</p>

<p>5. According to historians, Armenia, which was formerly
a small country, was enlarged by Artaxias and Zariadris,
who had been generals of Antiochus the Great, and at last,
after his overthrow, when they became kings, (the former
of Sophene, Acisene, (Amphissene?) Odomantis, and some
other places, the latter of the country about Artaxata,) they
simultaneously aggrandized themselves, by taking away portions
of the territory of the surrounding nations: from the
Medes they took the Caspiana, Phaunitis, and Basoropeda;
from the Iberians, the country at the foot of the Paryadres,
the Chorzene, and Gogarene, which is on the other
side of the Cyrus; from the Chalybes, and the Mosyn&#339;ci,
Carenitis and Xerxene, which border upon the Lesser Armenia,
or are even parts of it; from the Cataones, Acilisene,<a name="FNanchor_1060" id="FNanchor_1060"></a><a href="#Footnote_1060" class="fnanchor">1060</a>
and the country about the Anti-Taurus; from the Syrians,
Taronitis;<a name="FNanchor_1061" id="FNanchor_1061"></a><a href="#Footnote_1061" class="fnanchor">1061</a> hence they all speak the same language.</p>

<p>6. The cities of Armenia are Artaxata, called also Artaxiasata,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]<br />[CAS. 529]</a></span>
built by Hannibal for the king Artaxias, and Arxata,
both situated on the Araxes; Arxata on the confines of
Atropatia, and Artaxata near the Araxenian plain; it is
well inhabited, and the seat of the kings of the country. It
lies upon a peninsular elbow of land; the river encircles the
walls except at the isthmus, which is enclosed by a ditch
and rampart.</p>

<p>Not far from the city are the treasure-storehouses of Tigranes
and Artavasdes, the strong fortresses Babyrsa, and
Olane. There were others also upon the Euphrates. Ador,
(Addon?) the governor of the fortress, occasioned the revolt
of Artager&aelig;, but the generals of C&aelig;sar retook it after a
long siege, and destroyed the walls.</p>

<p>7. There are many rivers in the country. The most celebrated
are the Phasis and Lycus; they empty themselves
into the Euxine; (Eratosthenes instead of the Lycus mentions
the Thermodon, but erroneously;) the Cyrus and the
Araxes into the Caspian, and the Euphrates and the Tigris
into the Persian Gulf.</p>

<p><a name="xi_xiv_8" id="xi_xiv_8"></a>8. There are also large lakes in Armenia; one the Mantiane,<a name="FNanchor_1062" id="FNanchor_1062"></a><a href="#Footnote_1062" class="fnanchor">1062</a>
which word translated signifies Cyane, or Blue, the
largest salt-water lake, it is said, after the Palus M&aelig;otis, extending
as far as (Media-) Atropatia. It has salt pans for
the concretion of salt.</p>

<p>The next is Arsene,<a name="FNanchor_1063" id="FNanchor_1063"></a><a href="#Footnote_1063" class="fnanchor">1063</a> which is also called Thopitis. Its
waters contain nitre, and are used for cleaning and fulling
clothes. It is unfit by these qualities for drinking. The
Tigris passes through this lake<a name="FNanchor_1064" id="FNanchor_1064"></a><a href="#Footnote_1064" class="fnanchor">1064</a> after issuing from the mountainous
country near the Niphates, and by its rapidity keeps
its stream unmixed with the water of the lake, whence it has
its name, for the Medes call an arrow, Tigris. This river
contains fish of various kinds, but the lake one kind only.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span></p>

<p>At the extremity of the lake the river falls into a deep cavity
in the earth. After pursuing a long course under-ground, it
reappears in the Chalonitis; thence it goes to Opis, and to
the wall of Semiramis, as it is called, leaving the Gordy&aelig;i<a name="FNanchor_1065" id="FNanchor_1065"></a><a href="#Footnote_1065" class="fnanchor">1065</a>
and the whole of Mesopotamia on the right hand. The Euphrates,
on the contrary, has the same country on the left.
Having approached one another, and formed Mesopotamia, one
traverses Seleucia in its course to the Persian Gulf, the other
Babylon, as I have said in replying to Eratosthenes and
Hipparchus.</p>

<p>9. There are mines of gold in the Hyspiratis,<a name="FNanchor_1066" id="FNanchor_1066"></a><a href="#Footnote_1066" class="fnanchor">1066</a> near Caballa.
Alexander sent Menon to the mines with a body of
soldiers, but he was strangled<a name="FNanchor_1067" id="FNanchor_1067"></a><a href="#Footnote_1067" class="fnanchor">1067</a> by the inhabitants of the country.
There are other mines, and also a mine of Sandyx as
it is called, to which is given the name of Armenian colour,
it resembles the Calche.<a name="FNanchor_1068" id="FNanchor_1068"></a><a href="#Footnote_1068" class="fnanchor">1068</a></p>

<p>This country is so well adapted, being nothing inferior in this
respect to Media, for breeding horses, that the race of Nes&aelig;an
horses, which the kings of Persia used, is found here also;
the satrap of Armenia used to send annually to the king
of Persia 20,000 foals at the time of the festival of the Mithracina.
Artavasdes, when he accompanied Antony in his
invasion of Media, exhibited, besides other bodies of cavalry,
6000 horse covered with complete armour drawn up in array.</p>

<p>Not only do the Medes and Armenians, but the Albanians
also, admire this kind of cavalry, for the latter use horses
covered with armour.</p>

<p>10. Of the riches and power of this country, this is no
slight proof, that when Pompey imposed upon Tigranes, the
father of Artavasdes, the payment of 6000 talents of silver, he
immediately distributed the money among the Roman army,
to each soldier 50 drachm&aelig;, 1000 to a centurion, and a talent
to a Hipparch and a Chiliarch.</p>

<p>11. Theophanes represents this as the size of the country;
its breadth to be 100 sch&#339;ni, and its length double this number,
reckoning the sch&#339;nus at 40 stadia; but this computation
exceeds the truth. It is nearer the truth to take the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]<br />[CAS. 530]</a></span>
length as he has given it, and the breadth at one half, or a
little more.</p>

<p>Such then is the nature of the country of Armenia, and its
power.</p>

<p>12. There exists an ancient account of the origin of this
nation to the following effect. Armenus of Armenium, a Thessalian
city, which lies between Pher&aelig; and Larisa on the lake
B&#339;be, accompanied Jason, as we have already said, in his expedition
into Armenia, and from Armenus the country had
its name, according to Cyrsilus the Pharsalian and Medius
the Laris&aelig;an, persons who had accompanied the army of
Alexander. Some of the followers of Armenus settled in
Acilisene, which was formerly subject to the Sopheni; others
in the Syspiritis, and spread as far as Calachene and Adiabene,
beyond the borders of Armenia.</p>

<p>The dress of the Armenian people is said to be of Thessalian
origin; such are the long tunics, which in tragedies are called
Thessalian; they are fastened about the body with a girdle,
and with a clasp on the shoulder. The tragedians, for they
required some additional decoration of this kind, imitate the
Thessalians in their attire. The Thessalians in particular,
from wearing a long dress, (probably because they inhabit the
most northerly and the coldest country in all Greece,) afforded
the most appropriate subject of imitation to actors for their
theatrical representations. The passion for riding and the
care of horses characterize the Thessalians, and are common
to Armenians and Medes.</p>

<p>The Jasonia are evidence of the expedition of Jason: some
of these memorials the sovereigns of the country restored, as
Parmenio restored the temple of Jason at Abdera.</p>

<p>13. It is supposed that Armenus and his companions called
the Araxes by this name on account of its resemblance to
the Peneius, for the Peneius had the name of Araxes from
bursting through Tempe, and rending (&#7936;&#960;&#945;&#961;&#8049;&#958;&#945;&#953;) Ossa from
Olympus. The Araxes also in Armenia, descending from the
mountains, is said to have spread itself in ancient times, and
to have overflowed the plains, like a sea, having no outlet;
that Jason, in imitation of what is to be seen at Tempe, made
the opening through which the water at present precipitates
itself into the Caspian Sea; that upon this the Araxenian
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
plain, through which the river flows to the cataract, became
uncovered. This story which is told of the river Araxes
contains some probability; that of Herodotus<a name="FNanchor_1069" id="FNanchor_1069"></a><a href="#Footnote_1069" class="fnanchor">1069</a> none whatever.
For he says that, after flowing out of the country of the Matiani,
it is divided into forty rivers, and separates the Scythians
from the Bactrians. Callisthenes has followed Herodotus.</p>

<p>14. Some tribes of &AElig;nianes are mentioned, some of whom
settled in Vitia, others above the Armenians beyond the Abus
and the Nibarus. These latter are branches of Taurus; the
Abus is near the road which leads to Ecbatana by the temple
of Baris (Zaris?).</p>

<p>Some tribes of Thracians, surnamed Sarapar&aelig;, or decapitators,
are said to live above Armenia, near the Gouranii and
Medes. They are a savage people, intractable mountaineers,
and scalp and decapitate strangers; for such is the meaning
of the term Sarapar&aelig;.</p>

<p>I have spoken of Medeia in the account of Media, and it is
conjectured from all the circumstances that the Medes and
Armenians are allied in some way to the Thessalians, descended
from Jason and Medeia.</p>

<p><a name="xi_xiv_15" id="xi_xiv_15"></a>15. This is the ancient account, but the more recent, and
extending from the time of the Persians to our own age, may
be given summarily, and in part only (as follows); Persians
and Macedonians gained possession of Armenia, next those
who were masters of Syria and Media. The last was Orontes,
a descendant of Hydarnes, one of the seven Persians: it was
then divided into two portions by Artaxias and Zariadris,
generals of Antiochus the Great, who made war against the
Romans. These were governors by permission of the king,
but upon his overthrow they attached themselves to the Romans,
were declared independent, and had the title of kings.
Tigranes was a descendant of Artaxias, and had Armenia,
properly so called. This country was contiguous to Media,
to the Albani, and to the Iberes, and extended as far as Colchis,
and Cappadocia upon the Euxine.</p>

<p>Artanes the Sophenian was the descendant of Zariadris,
and had the southern parts of Armenia, which verge
rather to the west. He was defeated by Tigranes, who became
master of the whole country. He had experienced
many vicissitudes of fortune. At first he had served as a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]<br />[CAS. 532]</a></span>
hostage among the Parthians; then by their means he returned
to his country, in compensation for which service they obtained
seventy valleys in Armenia. When he acquired power,
he recovered these valleys, and devastated the country of the
Parthians, the territory about Ninus, and that about Arbela.<a name="FNanchor_1070" id="FNanchor_1070"></a><a href="#Footnote_1070" class="fnanchor">1070</a>
He subjected to his authority the Atropatenians, and the
Gordy&aelig;ans; by force of arms he obtained possession also of
the rest of Mesopotamia, and, after crossing the Euphrates, of
Syria and Ph&#339;nicia. Having attained this height of prosperity,
he even founded near Iberia,<a name="FNanchor_1071" id="FNanchor_1071"></a><a href="#Footnote_1071" class="fnanchor">1071</a> between this country
and the Zeugma on the Euphrates, a city, which he named
Tigranocerta, and collected inhabitants out of twelve Grecian
cities, which he had depopulated. But Lucullus, who had
commanded in the war against Mithridates, surprised him,
thus engaged, and dismissed the inhabitants to their respective
homes. The buildings which were half finished he demolished,
and left a small village remaining. He drove Tigranes
both out of Syria and Ph&#339;nicia.</p>

<p>Artavasdes, his successor, prospered as long as he continued
a friend of the Romans. But having betrayed Antony
to the Parthians in the war with that people, he suffered
punishment for his treachery. He was carried in chains to
Alexandria, by order of Antony, led in procession through
the city, and kept in prison for a time. On the breaking
out of the Actiac war he was then put to death. Many
kings reigned after Artavasdes, who were dependent upon
C&aelig;sar and the Romans. The country is still governed in
the same manner.</p>

<p>16. Both the Medes and Armenians have adopted all the
sacred rites of the Persians, but the Armenians pay particular
reverence to Ana&iuml;tis, and have built temples to her honour
in several places, especially in Acilisene. They dedicate
there to her service male and female slaves; in this there
is nothing remarkable, but it is surprising that persons of the
highest rank in the nation consecrate their virgin daughters
to the goddess. It is customary for these women, after being
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
prostituted a long period at the temple of Ana&iuml;tis, to be disposed
of in marriage, no one disdaining a connexion with
such persons. Herodotus mentions something similar respecting
the Lydian women, all of whom prostitute themselves.
But they treat their paramours with much kindness,
they entertain them hospitably, and frequently make a return
of more presents than they receive, being amply supplied
with means derived from their wealthy connexions. They
do not admit into their dwellings accidental strangers, but
prefer those of a rank equal to their own.</p>

<h2><big>BOOK XII.<br /><br />

CAPPADOCIA.</big><br /><br /></h2>

<p class="center f85">SUMMARY.</p>

<p class="indent">The Twelfth Book contains the remainder of Pontus, viz. Cappadocia, Galatia,
Bithynia, Mysia, Phrygia, and M&aelig;onia: the cities, Sinope in Pontus,
Heracleia, and Amaseia, and likewise Isauria, Lycia, Pamphylia, and
Cilicia, with the islands lying along the coast; the mountains and rivers.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p>1.<a name="FNanchor_1072" id="FNanchor_1072"></a><a href="#Footnote_1072" class="fnanchor">1072</a><span class="smcap">Cappadocia</span> consists of many parts, and has experienced
frequent changes.</p>

<p>The nations speaking the same language are chiefly those
who are bounded on the south by the Cilician Taurus,<a name="FNanchor_1073" id="FNanchor_1073"></a><a href="#Footnote_1073" class="fnanchor">1073</a> as it
is called; on the east by Armenia, Colchis, and by the intervening
nations who speak different languages; on the north
by the Euxine, as far as the mouth of the Halys;<a name="FNanchor_1074" id="FNanchor_1074"></a><a href="#Footnote_1074" class="fnanchor">1074</a> on the west
by the Paphlagonians, and by the Galatians, who migrated
into Phrygia, and spread themselves as far as Lycaonia, and
the Cilicians, who occupy Cilicia Tracheia (Cilicia the mountainous).<a name="FNanchor_1075" id="FNanchor_1075"></a><a href="#Footnote_1075" class="fnanchor">1075</a></p>

<p><a name="xii_i_2" id="xii_i_2"></a>2. Among the nations that speak the same language, the
ancients placed the Cataonians by themselves, contra-distinguishing
them from the Cappadocians, whom they considered
as a different people. In the enumeration of the nations
they placed Cataonia after Cappadocia, then the Euphrates,
and the nations on the other side of that river, so as to
include even Melitene in Cataonia, although Melitene lies
between Cataonia and the Euphrates, approaches close to
Commagene, and constitutes a tenth portion of Cappadocia,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
according to the division of the country into ten provinces.
For the kings in our times who preceded Archelaus<a name="FNanchor_1076" id="FNanchor_1076"></a><a href="#Footnote_1076" class="fnanchor">1076</a> usually
divided the kingdom of Cappadocia in this manner.</p>

<p>Cataonia is a tenth portion of Cappadocia. In our time
each province had its own governor, and since no difference
appears in the language of the Cataonians compared with
that of the other Cappadocians, nor any difference in their
customs, it is surprising how entirely the characteristic marks
of a foreign nation have disappeared, yet they were distinct
nations; Ariarathes, the first who bore the title of king of
the Cappadocians, annexed the Cataonians to Cappadocia.</p>

<p>3. This country composes the isthmus, as it were, of a
large peninsula formed by two seas; by the bay of Issus, extending
to Cilicia Tracheia, and by the Euxine lying between
Sinope and the coast of the Tibareni.</p>

<p>The isthmus cuts off what we call the peninsula; the whole
tract lying to the west of the Cappadocians, to which Herodotus<a name="FNanchor_1077" id="FNanchor_1077"></a><a href="#Footnote_1077" class="fnanchor">1077</a>
gives the name of the country within the Halys. This
is the country the whole of which was the kingdom of Cr&#339;sus.
Herodotus calls him king of the nations on this side the river
Halys. But writers of the present time give the name of
Asia, which is the appellation of the whole continent, to the
country within the Taurus.</p>

<p>This Asia comprises, first, the nations on the east, Paphlagonians,
Phrygians, and Lycaonians; then Bithynians, Mysians,
and the Epictetus; besides these, Troas, and Hellespontia;
next to these, and situated on the sea, are the &AElig;olians
and Ionians, who are Greeks; the inhabitants of the remaining
portions are Carians and Lycians, and in the inland parts
are Lydians.</p>

<p>We shall speak hereafter of the other nations.</p>

<p>4. The Macedonians obtained possession of Cappadocia
after it had been divided by the Persians into two satrapies,
and permitted, partly with and partly without the consent of
the people, the satrapies to be altered to two kingdoms, one
of which they called Cappadocia Proper, and Cappadocia
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]<br />[CAS. 534]</a></span>
near the Taurus, or Cappadocia the Great; the other they
called Pontus, but according to other writers, Cappadocia on
Pontus.</p>

<p>We are ignorant at present how Cappadocia the Great
was at first distributed; upon the death of Archelaus the
king, C&aelig;sar and the senate decreed that it should be a Roman
province. But when the country was divided in the
time of Archelaus and of preceding kings into ten provinces,
they reckoned five near the Taurus, Melitene, Cataonia,
Cilicia, Tyan&#299;tis, and Garsaur&#299;tis; the remaining five were
Laviansene, Sargarausene, Saravene, Chamanene, Morimene.
The Romans afterwards assigned to the predecessors of Archelaus
an eleventh province formed out of Cilicia, consisting
of the country about Castabala and Cybistra,<a name="FNanchor_1078" id="FNanchor_1078"></a><a href="#Footnote_1078" class="fnanchor">1078</a> extending
to Derbe, belonging to Antipater, the robber. Cilicia Trachea
about El&aelig;ussa was assigned to Archelaus, and all the
country which served as the haunts of pirates.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Melitene</span> resembles Commagene, for the whole of it is
planted with fruit-trees, and is the only part of all Cappadocia
which is planted in this manner. It produces oil, and the
wine Monarites, which vies with the wines of Greece. It is
situated opposite to Sophene, having the river Euphrates
flowing between it and Commagene, which borders upon it.
In the country on the other side of the river is Tomisa, a
considerable fortress of the Cappadocians. It was sold to the
prince of Sophene for a hundred talents. Lucullus presented
it afterwards as a reward of valour to the Cappadocian prince
for his services in the war against Mithridates.</p>

<p>2. Cataonia is a plain, wide and hollow,<a name="FNanchor_1079" id="FNanchor_1079"></a><a href="#Footnote_1079" class="fnanchor">1079</a> and produces
everything except evergreen trees. It is surrounded by
mountains, and among others by the Amanus on the side towards
the south, a mass separated from the Cilician Taurus,
and also by the Anti-Taurus,<a name="FNanchor_1080" id="FNanchor_1080"></a><a href="#Footnote_1080" class="fnanchor">1080</a> a mass rent off in a contrary
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
direction. The Amanus extends from Cataonia to Cilicia, and
the Syrian sea towards the west and south. In this intervening
space it comprises the whole of the gulf of Issus, and the
plains of the Cilicians which lie towards the Taurus. But
the Anti-Taurus inclines to the north, and a little also to the
east, and then terminates in the interior of the country.</p>

<p>3. In the Anti-Taurus are deep and narrow valleys, in
which is situated Comana,<a name="FNanchor_1081" id="FNanchor_1081"></a><a href="#Footnote_1081" class="fnanchor">1081</a> and the temple of Enyus (Bellona),
which they call Ma. It is a considerable city. It contains
a very great multitude of persons who at times are actuated
by divine impulse, and of servants of the temple. It is inhabited
by Cataonians, who are chiefly under the command of
the priest, but in other respects subject to the king. The
former presides over the temple, and has authority over the
servants belonging to it, who, at the time that I was there,
exceeded in number six thousand persons, including men and
women. A large tract of land adjoins the temple, the revenue
of which the priest enjoys. He is second in rank in Cappadocia
after the king, and, in general, the priests are descended
from the same family as the kings. Orestes, when he came
hither with his sister Iphigenia from Tauric Scythia,<a name="FNanchor_1082" id="FNanchor_1082"></a><a href="#Footnote_1082" class="fnanchor">1082</a> is
thought to have introduced the sacred rites performed in
honour of Diana Tauropolus, and to have deposited here the
tresses (Coman, &#954;&#8057;&#956;&#951;&#957;) of mourning, from which the city had
the name of Comana.</p>

<p>The river Sarus flows through this city, and passes out
through the valleys of the Taurus to the plains of Cilicia, and
to the sea lying below them.</p>

<p>4. The Pyramus,<a name="FNanchor_1083" id="FNanchor_1083"></a><a href="#Footnote_1083" class="fnanchor">1083</a> which has its source in the middle of the
plain, is navigable throughout Cataonia. There is a large subterraneous
channel, through which the water flows under-ground
to a great distance, and then may be seen springing up again to
the surface. If an arrow is let down into the pit from above, the
resistance of the water is so great that it is scarcely immersed.
Although it pursues its course with great<a name="FNanchor_1084" id="FNanchor_1084"></a><a href="#Footnote_1084" class="fnanchor">1084</a> depth and breadth,
it undergoes an extraordinary contraction of its size by the
time it has reached the Taurus. There is also an extraordinary
fissure in the mountain, through which the stream is
carried. For, as in rocks which have burst and split in two
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]<br />[CAS. 536]</a></span>
parts, the projections in one correspond so exactly with the
hollows in the other that they might even be fitted together,
so here I have seen the rocks at the distance of two or three
plethra, overhanging the river on each side, and nearly reaching
to the summit of the mountain, with hollows on one side
answering to projections on the other. The bed between (the
mountains) is entirely rock; it has a deep and very narrow
fissure through the middle, so that a dog and a hare might
leap across it. This is the channel of the river; it is full to
the margin, and in breadth resembles a canal.<a name="FNanchor_1085" id="FNanchor_1085"></a><a href="#Footnote_1085" class="fnanchor">1085</a> But on account
of the winding of its course, the great contraction of
the stream, and the depth of the ravine, a noise, like that of
thunder, strikes at a distance on the ears of those who approach
it. In passing out through the mountains, it brings
down from Cataonia, and from the Cilician plains, so great a
quantity of alluvial soil to the sea, that an oracle to the following
effect is reported to have been uttered respecting it:</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;The time will come, when Pyramus, with its deep whirlpools, by advancing
on the sea-shore, will reach the sacred Cyprus.&#8221;</p>

<p>Something similar to this takes place in Egypt. The Nile
is continually converting the sea into continent by an accumulation
of earth; accordingly Herodotus calls Egypt a gift
of the river, and Homer says, that the Pharos was formerly
out at sea, not as it is at present connected with the mainland
of Egypt.</p>

<p>5. [The third<a name="FNanchor_1086" id="FNanchor_1086"></a><a href="#Footnote_1086" class="fnanchor">1086</a> in rank is the Dacian priesthood of Jupiter,
inferior to this, but still of importance.] There is at this
place a body of salt water, having the circumference of a considerable
lake. It is shut in by lofty and perpendicular hills,
so that the descent is by steps. The water it is said does not
increase in quantity, nor has it anywhere an apparent outlet.</p>

<p>6. Neither the plain of the Cataonians nor Melitene have
any city, but strongholds upon the mountains, as Azamora, and
Dastarcum, round which runs the river Carmalas.<a name="FNanchor_1087" id="FNanchor_1087"></a><a href="#Footnote_1087" class="fnanchor">1087</a> There
is also the temple of the Cataonian Apollo, which is venerated
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
throughout the whole of Cappadocia, and which the
Cappadocians have taken as a model of their own temples.
Nor have the other provinces, except two, any cities. Of the
rest, Sargarausene has a small town Herpa, and a river Carmalas,
which also discharges itself into the Cilician sea.<a name="FNanchor_1088" id="FNanchor_1088"></a><a href="#Footnote_1088" class="fnanchor">1088</a> In
the other provinces is Argos, a lofty fortress near the Taurus,
and Nora, now called Neroassus, in which Eumenes sustained
a long siege. In our time it was a treasure-hold of Sisinus,
who attempted to take possession of the kingdom of Cappadocia.
To him belonged Cadena, a royal seat, built after the
form of a city. Situated upon the borders of Lycaonia is
Garsauira, a village town, said to have been formerly the
capital of the country.</p>

<p>In Morimene, among the Venasii, is a temple of Jupiter,
with buildings capable of receiving nearly three thousand servants
of the temple. It has a tract of sacred land attached to
it, very fertile, and affording to the priest a yearly revenue of
fifteen talents. The priest is appointed for life like the priest
at Comana, and is next to him in rank.</p>

<p>7. Two provinces only have cities. In the Tyanitis is
Tyana,<a name="FNanchor_1089" id="FNanchor_1089"></a><a href="#Footnote_1089" class="fnanchor">1089</a> lying at the foot of the Taurus at the Cilician Gates,<a name="FNanchor_1090" id="FNanchor_1090"></a><a href="#Footnote_1090" class="fnanchor">1090</a>
where are the easiest and the most frequented passes into
Cilicia and Syria. It is called, &#8220;Eusebeia at the Taurus.&#8221;
Tyanitis is fertile, and the greatest part of it consists of
plains. Tyana is built upon the mound of Semiramis, which
is fortified with good walls. At a little distance from this
city are Castabala and Cybistra, towns which approach still
nearer to the mountain. At Castabala is a temple of Diana
Perasia, where, it is said, the priestesses walk with naked
feet unhurt upon burning coals. To this place some persons
apply the story respecting Orestes and Diana Tauropolus, and
say that the goddess was called Perasia, because she was conveyed
from beyond (&#960;&#8051;&#961;&#945;&#952;&#949;&#957;) sea.</p>

<p>In Tyanitis, one of the ten provinces above mentioned, is
the city Tyana. But with these I do not reckon the cities
that were afterwards added, Castabala, and Cybistra, and
those in Cilicia Tracheia, to which belongs El&aelig;ussa, a small
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]<br />[CAS. 538]</a></span>
fertile island, which Archelaus furnished with excellent
buildings, where he passed the greater part of his time.</p>

<p>In the Cilician province, as it is called, is Mazaca,<a name="FNanchor_1091" id="FNanchor_1091"></a><a href="#Footnote_1091" class="fnanchor">1091</a> the
capital of the nation. It is also called &#8220;Eusebeia,&#8221; with the
addition &#8220;at the Arg&aelig;us,&#8221; for it is situated at the foot of the
Arg&aelig;us,<a name="FNanchor_1092" id="FNanchor_1092"></a><a href="#Footnote_1092" class="fnanchor">1092</a> the highest mountain in that district; its summit is
always covered with snow. Persons who ascend it (but
they are not many) say that both the Euxine and the sea of
Issus may be seen from thence in clear weather.</p>

<p>Mazaca is not adapted in other respects by nature for the
settlement of a city, for it is without water, and unfortified.
Through the neglect of the governors, it is without walls, perhaps
intentionally, lest, trusting to the wall as to a fortification,
the inhabitants of a plain, which has hills situated above it, and
not exposed to the attacks of missile weapons, should addict
themselves to robbery. The country about, although it consists
of plains, is entirely barren and uncultivated, for the soil
is sandy, and rocky underneath. At a little distance further
there are burning plains, and pits full of fire to an extent of
many stadia, so that the necessaries of life are brought from a
distance. What seems to be a peculiar advantage (abundance
of wood) is a source of danger. For though nearly the whole
of Cappadocia is without timber, the Arg&aelig;us is surrounded
by a forest, so that wood may be procured near at hand, yet
even the region lying below the forest contains fire in many
parts, and springs of cold water; but as neither the fire nor
the water break out upon the surface, the greatest part of the
country is covered with herbage. In some parts the bottom
is marshy, and flames burst out from the ground by night.
Those acquainted with the country collect wood with caution;
but there is danger to others, and particularly to cattle, which
fall into these hidden pits of fire.</p>

<p>8. In the plain in front of the city, and about 40 stadia
from it, is a river of the name of Melas,<a name="FNanchor_1093" id="FNanchor_1093"></a><a href="#Footnote_1093" class="fnanchor">1093</a> whose source is in
ground lower than the level of the city. It is useless to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
inhabitants, because it does not flow from an elevated situation.
It spreads abroad in marshes and lakes, and in the summer-time
corrupts the air round the city. A valuable stone
quarry is rendered almost useless by it. For there are extensive
beds of stone, from which the Mazaceni obtain an
abundant supply of materials for building, but the slabs, being
covered with water, are not easily detached by the workmen.
These are the marshes which in every part are subject
to take fire.</p>

<p>Ariarathes the king filled in some narrow channels by
which the Melas entered the Halys, and converted the neighbouring
plain into a wide lake. There he selected some small
islands like the Cyclades, where he passed his time in boyish
and frivolous diversions. The barrier, however, was broken
down all at once, and the waters again flowed abroad and
swelled the Halys, which swept away a large part of the Cappadocian
territory, and destroyed many buildings and plantations;
it also damaged a considerable part of the country of
the Galatians, who occupy Phrygia. In compensation for
this injury he paid a fine of three hundred talents to the inhabitants,
who had referred the matter to the decision of the
Romans. The same was the case at Herpa; for he there
obstructed the stream of the Carmalas, and, on the bursting
of the dyke, the water damaged some of the places in the
Cilician territories about Mallus; he was obliged to make
compensation to those who had sustained injury.</p>

<p>9. Although the territory of the Mazaceni is destitute in
many respects of natural advantages, it seems to have been
preferred by the kings as a place of residence, because it was
nearest the centre of those districts which supplied timber,
stone for building, and fodder, of which a very large quantity
was required for the subsistence of their cattle. Their city
was almost a camp. The security of their persons and treasure<a name="FNanchor_1094" id="FNanchor_1094"></a><a href="#Footnote_1094" class="fnanchor">1094</a>
depended upon the protection afforded by numerous
fortresses, some of which belonged to the king, others to their
friends.</p>

<p>Mazaca is distant from Pontus<a name="FNanchor_1095" id="FNanchor_1095"></a><a href="#Footnote_1095" class="fnanchor">1095</a> about 800 stadia to the
south, and from the Euphrates a little less than double that
distance; from the Cilician Gates and the camp of Cyrus, a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]<br />[CAS. 539]</a></span>
journey of six days by way of Tyana,<a name="FNanchor_1096" id="FNanchor_1096"></a><a href="#Footnote_1096" class="fnanchor">1096</a> which is situated about
the middle of the route, and is distant from Cybistra 300
stadia. The Mazaceni adopt the laws of Charondas, and elect
a Nom&#333;dist, (or Chanter of the Laws,) who, like the Jurisconsults
of the Romans, is the interpreter of their laws. Tigranes
the Armenian, when he overran Cappadocia, treated
them with great severity. He forced them to abandon their
settlements, and go into Mesopotamia; they peopled Tigranocerta,
chiefly by their numbers. Afterwards, upon the capture
of Tigranocerta, those who were able returned to their
own country.</p>

<p>10. The breadth of the country from Pontus to the Taurus is
about 1800 stadia; the length from Lycaonia and Phrygia, as
far as the Euphrates to the east, and Armenia, is about 3000
stadia. The soil is fertile, and abounds with fruits of the
earth, particularly corn, and with cattle of all kinds. Although
it lies more to the south than Pontus, it is colder. Bagadania,
although a plain country, and situated more towards the south
than any district in Cappadocia, (for it lies at the foot of the
Taurus,) produces scarcely any fruit-bearing trees. It affords
pasture for wild asses, as does a large portion of the other
parts of the country, particularly that about Garsauira, Lycaonia,
and Morimene.</p>

<p>In Cappadocia is found the red earth called the Sinopic,
which is better than that of any other country. The Spanish
only can rival it. It had the name of Sinopic, because the
merchants used to bring it down from Sinope, before the traffic
of the Ephesians extended as far as the people of Cappadocia.
It is said that even plates of crystal and of the onyx stone were
discovered by the miners of Archelaus near the country of the
Galatians. There was a place where was found a white stone
of the colour of ivory in pieces of the size of small whetstones,
from which were made handles for small swords. Another
place produced large masses of transparent stone for windows,
which were exported.</p>

<p>The boundary of Pontus and Cappadocia is a mountainous
range parallel to the Taurus, commencing from the western
extremities of Chammanene, (where stands Dasmenda, a fortress
built upon a precipice,) and extending to the eastern parts of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
Laviansene. Both Chammanene and Laviansene are provinces
of Cappadocia.</p>

<p>11. When the Romans, after the defeat of Antiochus, first
governed Asia, they made treaties of friendship and alliance
both with the nations and with the kings. This honour was
conferred upon the other kings separately and independently,
but upon the king of Cappadocia in common with the nation.
On the extinction of the royal race, the Romans admitted the
independence of the Cappadocians according to the treaty of
friendship and alliance which they had made with the nation.
The deputies excused themselves from accepting the liberty
which was offered to them, declaring that they were unable to
bear it, and requested that a king might be appointed. The
Romans were surprised that any people should be unwilling
to enjoy liberty, but permitted<a name="FNanchor_1097" id="FNanchor_1097"></a><a href="#Footnote_1097" class="fnanchor">1097</a> them to elect by suffrage any
one they pleased from among themselves. They elected
Ariobarzanes. The race became extinct in the third generation.
Archelaus, who was not connected with the nation,
was appointed king by Antony.</p>

<p>So much respecting the Greater Cappadocia.</p>

<p>With regard to Cilicia Tracheia, which was annexed to
the Greater Cappadocia, it will be better to describe it when
we give an account of the whole of Cilicia.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Mithridates</span> Eupator was appointed King of Pontus.
His kingdom consisted of the country bounded by the Halys,<a name="FNanchor_1098" id="FNanchor_1098"></a><a href="#Footnote_1098" class="fnanchor">1098</a>
extending to the Tibareni,<a name="FNanchor_1099" id="FNanchor_1099"></a><a href="#Footnote_1099" class="fnanchor">1099</a> to Armenia, to the territory
within the Halys, extending as far as Amastris,<a name="FNanchor_1100" id="FNanchor_1100"></a><a href="#Footnote_1100" class="fnanchor">1100</a> and to some
parts of Paphlagonia. He annexed to (the kingdom of) Pontus
the sea-coast towards the west as far as Heracleia,<a name="FNanchor_1101" id="FNanchor_1101"></a><a href="#Footnote_1101" class="fnanchor">1101</a> the birth-place
of Heracleides the Platonic philosopher, and towards
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]<br />[CAS. 541]</a></span>
the east, the country extending to Colchis, and the Lesser
Armenia. Pompey, after the overthrow of Mithridates, found
the kingdom comprised within these boundaries. He distributed
the country towards Armenia and towards Colchis
among the princes who had assisted him in the war; the remainder
he divided into eleven governments, and annexed
them to Bithynia, so that out of both there was formed one
province. Some people in the inland parts he subjected to the
kings descended from Pyl&aelig;menes, in the same manner as he
delivered over the Galatians to be governed by tetrarchs of
that nation.</p>

<p>In later times the Roman emperors made different divisions
of the same country, appointing kings and rulers, making
some cities free, and subjecting others to the authority of rulers,
others again were left under the dominion of the Roman people.</p>

<p>As we proceed in our description according to the present
state of things, we shall touch slightly on their former condition,
whenever it may be useful.</p>

<p>I shall begin from Heracleia,<a name="FNanchor_1102" id="FNanchor_1102"></a><a href="#Footnote_1102" class="fnanchor">1102</a> which is the most westerly
of these places.</p>

<p>2. In sailing out of the Propontis into the Euxine Sea, on
the left hand are the parts adjoining to Byzantium, (Constantinople,)
and these belong to the Thracians. The parts
on the left of the Pontus are called Aristera (or left) of Pontus;
the parts on the right are contiguous to Chalcedon. Of
these the first tract of country belongs to the Bithynians, the
next to the Mariandyni, or, as some say, to the Caucones; next
is that of the Paphlagonians, extending to the Halys, then that
of the Cappadocians near the Pontus, and then a district
reaching to Colchis.<a name="FNanchor_1103" id="FNanchor_1103"></a><a href="#Footnote_1103" class="fnanchor">1103</a> All this country has the name of the
Dexia (or right) of Pontus. This whole coast, from Colchis
to Heracleia, was subject to Mithridates Eupator. But
the parts on the other side to the mouth of the Euxine and
Chalcedon, remained under the government of the king of
Bithynia. After the overthrow of the kings the Romans preserved
the same boundaries of the kingdoms; Heracleia was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
annexed to Pontus, and the country beyond assigned to the
Bithynians.</p>

<p>3. It is generally acknowledged by writers, that the Bithynians,
who were formerly Mysians, received this name from
Bithynians and Thyni, Thracian people, who came and settled
among them. They advance as a proof of their statement,
first as regards the Bithynians, that there still exists in Thrace
a people called Bithynians, and then, as regards the Thyni,
that the sea-shore, near Apollonia<a name="FNanchor_1104" id="FNanchor_1104"></a><a href="#Footnote_1104" class="fnanchor">1104</a> and Salmydessus,<a name="FNanchor_1105" id="FNanchor_1105"></a><a href="#Footnote_1105" class="fnanchor">1105</a> is called
Thynias. The Bebryces, who preceded them as settlers in
Mysia, were, as I conjecture, Thracians. We have said<a name="FNanchor_1106" id="FNanchor_1106"></a><a href="#Footnote_1106" class="fnanchor">1106</a> that
the Mysians themselves were a colony of those Thracians who
are now called M&aelig;si.</p>

<p>Such is the account given of these people.</p>

<p>4. There is not, however, the same agreement among writers
with regard to the Mariandyni, and the Caucones. For they
say that Heracleia is situated among the Mariandyni, and was
founded by Milesians.<a name="FNanchor_1107" id="FNanchor_1107"></a><a href="#Footnote_1107" class="fnanchor">1107</a> But who they are, or whence they
came, nothing is said. There is no difference in language,
nor any other apparent national distinction between them and
the Bithynians, whom they resemble in all respects. It is
probable therefore the Mariandyni were a Thracian tribe.</p>

<p>Theopompus says that Mariandynus, who governed a part
of Paphlagonia, which was subject to many masters, invaded
and obtained possession of the country of the Bebryces, and
that he gave his own name to the territory which he had before
occupied. It is also said that the Milesians who first
founded Heracleia, compelled the Mariandyni, the former possessors
of the place, to serve as Helots, and even sold them,
but not beyond the boundaries of their country. For they
were sold on the same conditions as the class of persons called
Mnoans, who were slaves to the Cretans, and the Penest&aelig;,<a name="FNanchor_1108" id="FNanchor_1108"></a><a href="#Footnote_1108" class="fnanchor">1108</a>
who were slaves of the Thessalians.</p>

<p><a name="xii_iii_5" id="xii_iii_5"></a>5. The Caucones, who, according to history, inhabited the
line of sea-coast which extends from the Mariandyni as far as
the river Parthenius, and to whom belonged the city Tieium,<a name="FNanchor_1109" id="FNanchor_1109"></a><a href="#Footnote_1109" class="fnanchor">1109</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]<br />[CAS. 542]</a></span>
are said by some writers to be Scythians, by others a tribe of
Macedonians, and by others a tribe of Pelasgi. We have
already spoken of these people elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_1110" id="FNanchor_1110"></a><a href="#Footnote_1110" class="fnanchor">1110</a> Callisthenes in
his comment upon the enumeration of the ships inserts after
this verse,</p>

<p>for the territory extends from Heracleia, and the Mariandyni
as far as the Leucosyri, whom we call Cappadocians. But
the tribe of the Caucones about Tieium extends to the Parthenius;
that of the Heneti, who occupy Cytorum,<a name="FNanchor_1112" id="FNanchor_1112"></a><a href="#Footnote_1112" class="fnanchor">1112</a> immediately
follows the Parthenius, and even at present some
Caucones are living about the Parthenius.</p>

<p>6. Heracleia is a city with a good harbour, and of importance
in other respects. It has sent out colonies, among which
are the Cherronesus,<a name="FNanchor_1113" id="FNanchor_1113"></a><a href="#Footnote_1113" class="fnanchor">1113</a> and the Callatis.<a name="FNanchor_1114" id="FNanchor_1114"></a><a href="#Footnote_1114" class="fnanchor">1114</a> It was once independent,
afterwards for some time it was under the power of
tyrants; it again recovered its freedom; but at last, when
subject to the Romans, it was governed by kings. It received
a colony of Romans, which was settled in a portion of
the city, and of its territory. A little before the battle of Actium,
Adiatorix, the son of Domnecleius the tetrarch of Galatia,
who had received from Antony that portion of the city of
which the Heracleiot&aelig; were in possession, attacked the Romans
by night, and put them to death by the command, as he
said, of Antony; but after the victory at Actium, he was led
in triumph, and put to death together with his son. The city
belongs to the province of Pontus, which was annexed to
Bithynia.</p>

<p>7. Between Chalcedon and Heracleia are several rivers, as
the Psillis,<a name="FNanchor_1115" id="FNanchor_1115"></a><a href="#Footnote_1115" class="fnanchor">1115</a> the Calpas, and the Sangarius, of which last the
poet makes mention.<a name="FNanchor_1116" id="FNanchor_1116"></a><a href="#Footnote_1116" class="fnanchor">1116</a> It has its source at the village Sangias,
at the distance of 150 stadia from Pessinus. It flows through
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
the greater part of Phrygia Epictetus, and a part also of
Bithynia, so that it is distant from Nicomedia a little more
than 300 stadia, where the river Gallus unites with it. The
latter river has its source at Modra in Phrygia on the Hellespont,
which is the same country as the Epictetus, and was
formerly occupied by the Bithynians.</p>

<p>The Sangarius thus increased in bulk, and navigable, although
not so formerly, is the boundary of Bithynia at the part
of the coast where it discharges itself. In front of this coast
is the island Thynia.</p>

<p>In the territory of Heracleia grows the aconite.</p>

<p>This city is distant from the temple at Chalcedon about
1500, and from the Sangarius 500, stadia.</p>

<p>8. Tieium is now a small town and has nothing remarkable
belonging to it, except that it was the birth-place of Philet&aelig;rus,
the founder of the family of the Attalic kings.</p>

<p>Next is the river Parthenius, flowing through a country
abounding with flowers; from these it obtained its name.<a name="FNanchor_1117" id="FNanchor_1117"></a><a href="#Footnote_1117" class="fnanchor">1117</a>
Its source is in Paphlagonia. Then succeeded Paphlagonia,
and the Heneti. It is a question what Heneti the poet
means, when he says,</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;the brave Pyl&aelig;menes led the Paphlagonians out of the country of the
Heneti, where they have a race of wild mules;&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1118" id="FNanchor_1118"></a><a href="#Footnote_1118" class="fnanchor">1118</a></p>

<p>for at present, they say, no Heneti are to be found in Paphlagonia.
Others say that it is a village on the shore distant
ten sch&#339;ni from Amastris. But Zenodotus writes the verse
in this manner, &#8220;From Heneta,&#8221; and says that it means the
present Amisus. According to others it was a tribe bordering
upon the Cappadocians, which engaged in an expedition
with the Cimmerians, and were afterwards driven away into
Adria. But the account most generally received is, that the
Heneti were the most considerable tribe of the Paphlagonians;
that Pyl&aelig;menes was descended from it; that a large body of
this people accompanied him to the Trojan war; that when
they had lost their leader they passed over to Thrace upon
the capture of Troy; and in the course of their wanderings
arrived at the present Henetic territory.</p>

<p>Some writers say that both Antenor and his sons participated
in this expedition, and settled at the inner recess of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]<br />[CAS. 544]</a></span>
gulf of Adria, as we have said in the description of Italy.<a name="FNanchor_1119" id="FNanchor_1119"></a><a href="#Footnote_1119" class="fnanchor">1119</a> It
is probable that this was the cause of the extinction of the
Heneti, and that they were no longer to be found in Paphlagonia.</p>

<p>9. The boundary of the Paphlagonians to the east is the
river Halys, which flows from the south between the Syrians
and the Paphlagonians; and according to Herodotus,<a name="FNanchor_1120" id="FNanchor_1120"></a><a href="#Footnote_1120" class="fnanchor">1120</a> (who
means Cappadocians, when he is speaking of Syrians,) discharges
itself into the Euxine Sea. Even at present they are
called Leuco-Syrians, (or White Syrians,) while those without
the Taurus are called Syrians. In comparison with the people
within the Taurus, the latter have a burnt complexion;
but the former, not having it, received the appellation of Leuco-Syrians
(or White Syrians). Pindar says that</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;the Amazons commanded a Syrian band, armed with spears with broad
iron heads;&#8221;</p>

<p>thus designating the people that lived at Themiscyra.<a name="FNanchor_1121" id="FNanchor_1121"></a><a href="#Footnote_1121" class="fnanchor">1121</a> Themiscyra
belongs to the Amiseni,<a name="FNanchor_1122" id="FNanchor_1122"></a><a href="#Footnote_1122" class="fnanchor">1122</a> and the district of the
Amiseni to the Leuco-Syrians settled beyond the Halys.</p>

<p>The river Halys forms the boundary of the Paphlagonians
to the east; Phrygians and the Galatians settled among that
people, on the south; and on the west Bithynians and Mariandyni
(for the race of the Caucones has everywhere entirely
disappeared); on the north the Euxine. This country is
divided into two parts, the inland, and the maritime, extending
from the Halys as far as Bithynia. Mithridates Eupator
possessed the maritime part as far as Heracleia, and of the
inland country he had the district nearest to Heracleia, some
parts of which extended even beyond the Halys. These are
also the limits of the Roman province of Pontus. The remainder
was subject to chiefs, even after the overthrow of
Mithridates.</p>

<p>We shall afterwards speak of those Paphlagonians in the
inland parts, who were not subject to Mithridates; we propose
at present to describe the country which he governed, called
Pontus.</p>

<p>10. After the river Parthenius is Amastris, bearing the
same name as the princess by whom it was founded. It is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
situated upon a peninsula, with harbours on each side of the
isthmus. Amastris was the wife of Dionysius, the tyrant of
Heracleia, and daughter of Oxyathres, the brother of the
Darius who fought against Alexander. She formed the settlement
out of four cities, Sesamus, Cytorum, Cromna, (mentioned
by Homer in his recital of the Paphlagonian forces,<a name="FNanchor_1123" id="FNanchor_1123"></a><a href="#Footnote_1123" class="fnanchor">1123</a>)
and Tieium, which city however soon separated from the
others, but the rest continued united. Of these, Sesamus is
called the citadel of Amastris. Cytorum was formerly a mart
of the people of Sinope. It had its name from Cytorus, the
son of Phrixus, according to Ephorus. Box-wood of the best
quality grows in great abundance in the territory of Amastris,
and particularly about Cytorum.</p>

<p>&AElig;gialus is a line of sea-coast, in length more than 100 stadia.
On it is a village of the same name,<a name="FNanchor_1124" id="FNanchor_1124"></a><a href="#Footnote_1124" class="fnanchor">1124</a> which the poet mentions
in these lines,</p>

<p>The Erythini are said to be the present Erythrini, and to have
their name from their (red) colour. They are two rocks.<a name="FNanchor_1126" id="FNanchor_1126"></a><a href="#Footnote_1126" class="fnanchor">1126</a></p>

<p>Next to &AElig;gialus is Carambis, a large promontory stretching
towards the north, and the Scythian Chersonesus. We have
frequently mentioned this promontory, and the Criu-metopon

<p>It is a village of the Sinopenses, with a harbour.</p>

<p>11. Next is Sinope itself, distant from Armene 50 stadia,
the most considerable of all the cities in that quarter. It was
founded by Milesians, and when the inhabitants had established
a naval force they commanded the sea within the Cyanean
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]<br />[CAS. 545]</a></span>
rocks, and were allies of the Greeks in many naval battles
beyond these limits. Although this city was independent for
a long period, it did not preserve its liberty to the last, but
was taken by siege, and became subject first to Pharnaces,
then to his successors, to the time when the Romans put an
end to the power of Mithridates Eupator. This prince was
born and brought up in this city, on which he conferred distinguished
honour, and made it a capital of the kingdom. It
has received advantages from nature which have been improved
by art. It is built upon the neck of a peninsula; on
each side of the isthmus are harbours, stations for vessels, and
fisheries worthy of admiration for the capture of the pelamydes.
Of these fisheries we have said<a name="FNanchor_1131" id="FNanchor_1131"></a><a href="#Footnote_1131" class="fnanchor">1131</a> that the people of
Sinope have the second, and the Byzantines the third, in
point of excellence.</p>

<p>The peninsula projects in a circular form; the shores are
surrounded by a chain of rocks, and in some parts there are
cavities, like rocky pits, which are called Ch&#339;nicides. These
are filled when the sea is high. For the above reason, the
place is not easily approached; besides which, along the whole
surface of rock the road is covered with sharp-pointed stones,
and persons cannot walk upon it with naked feet. The lands
in the higher parts and above the city have a good soil, and
are adorned with fields dressed as gardens, and this is the case
in a still greater degree in the suburbs. The city itself is
well secured with walls, and magnificently ornamented with
a gymnasium, forum, and porticos. Notwithstanding these
advantages for defence, it was twice taken; first by Pharnaces,
who attacked it unexpectedly; afterwards by Lucullus,
who besieged it while it was harassed by an insidious tyrant
within the walls. For Bacchides,<a name="FNanchor_1132" id="FNanchor_1132"></a><a href="#Footnote_1132" class="fnanchor">1132</a> who was appointed by the
king commander of the garrison, being always suspicious of
treachery on the part of those within the city, had disgraced
and put many to death. He thus prevented the citizens both
from defending themselves with bravery, although capable of
making a gallant defence, and from offering terms for a capitulation.
The city was therefore captured. Lucullus took away
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
the Sphere of Billarus,<a name="FNanchor_1133" id="FNanchor_1133"></a><a href="#Footnote_1133" class="fnanchor">1133</a> and the Autolycus,<a name="FNanchor_1134" id="FNanchor_1134"></a><a href="#Footnote_1134" class="fnanchor">1134</a> the workmanship
of Sthenis, whom the citizens regarded as a founder, and
honoured as a god; he left the other ornaments of the city
untouched. There was there an oracle of Sthenis. He seems
to have been one of the companions of Jason in his voyage,
and to have got possession of this place. In after times the
Milesians, observing the natural advantages of the city, and the
weakness of the inhabitants, appropriated it as their own, and
sent out colonists. It has at present a Roman colony, and a part
of the city and of the territory belongs to the Romans. It is
distant from Hieron<a name="FNanchor_1135" id="FNanchor_1135"></a><a href="#Footnote_1135" class="fnanchor">1135</a> 3500, from Heracleia 2000, and from
Carambis 700, stadia. It has produced men distinguished
among philosophers, Diogenes the Cynic, and Timotheus surnamed
Patrion; among poets, Diphilus, the writer of comedy;
among historians, Baton,<a name="FNanchor_1136" id="FNanchor_1136"></a><a href="#Footnote_1136" class="fnanchor">1136</a> who wrote the history of Persia.</p>

<p>12. Proceeding thence, next in order is the mouth of the
river Halys. It has its name from the <i>hales</i>, or salt mines,<a name="FNanchor_1137" id="FNanchor_1137"></a><a href="#Footnote_1137" class="fnanchor">1137</a>
near which it flows. It has its source in the Greater Cappadocia,
near the territory of Pontus, in Camisene. It flows
in a large stream towards the west, then turning to the north
through the country of the Galatians and Paphlagonians, forms
the boundary of their territory, and of that of the Leuco-Syrians.
The tract of land belonging to Sinope and all the mountainous
country as far as Bithynia, situated above the sea-coast, which
has been described, furnishes timber of excellent quality for
ship-building, and is easily conveyed away. The territory of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]<br />[CAS. 546]</a></span>
Sinope produces the maple, and the mountain nut tree, from
which wood for tables is cut. The whole country is planted
with the olive, and cultivation begins a little above the sea-coast.</p>

<p>13. Next to the mouth of the Halys is Gadilon&iacute;tis, extending
as far as the Saramene; it is a fertile country, wholly consisting
of plains, and produces every kind of fruit. It affords
also pasture for flocks of sheep which are covered<a name="FNanchor_1138" id="FNanchor_1138"></a><a href="#Footnote_1138" class="fnanchor">1138</a> with skins,
and produce a soft wool; very little of this wool is to be found
throughout Cappadocia and Pontus. There are also deer,<a name="FNanchor_1139" id="FNanchor_1139"></a><a href="#Footnote_1139" class="fnanchor">1139</a>
which are rare in other parts.</p>

<p>The Amiseni possess one part of this country. Pompey
gave another to De&iuml;otarus, as well as the tract about Pharnacia
and Trapezus as far as Colchis and the Lesser Armenia.
Pompey appointed him king of these people and countries: he
had already inherited the tetrarchy of the Galatians, called the
Tolistobogii. Upon his death various persons succeeded to
the different parts of his kingdom.</p>

<p>14. Next to Gadilon<a name="FNanchor_1140" id="FNanchor_1140"></a><a href="#Footnote_1140" class="fnanchor">1140</a> are the Saramene,<a name="FNanchor_1141" id="FNanchor_1141"></a><a href="#Footnote_1141" class="fnanchor">1141</a> and Amisus, a
considerable city distant from Sinope about 900 stadia. Theopompus
says that the Milesians were the first founders, *
* * * * * *<a name="FNanchor_1142" id="FNanchor_1142"></a><a href="#Footnote_1142" class="fnanchor">1142</a> [then by] a chief of the
Cappadocians; in the third place it received a colony of
Athenians under the conduct of Athenocles, and its name was
changed to Pir&aelig;eus.</p>

<p>This city also was in the possession of the kings. Mithridates
Eupator embellished it with temples, and added a part
to it. Lucullus, and afterwards Pharnaces, who came from
across the Bosporus, besieged it. Antony surrendered it to
the kings of Pontus, after it had been declared free by Divus
C&aelig;sar. Then the Tyrant Strato oppressed the inhabitants,
who again recovered their liberty under C&aelig;sar Augustus after
the battle of Actium. They are now in a prosperous condition.
Among other fertile spots is Themiscyra,<a name="FNanchor_1143" id="FNanchor_1143"></a><a href="#Footnote_1143" class="fnanchor">1143</a> the abode of
the Amazons, and Sidene.<a name="FNanchor_1144" id="FNanchor_1144"></a><a href="#Footnote_1144" class="fnanchor">1144</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span></p>

<p>15. Themiscyra is a plain, partly washed by the sea, and
distant about 60 stadia from the city (Amisus); and partly
situated at the foot of a mountainous country, which is well
wooded, and intersected with rivers, which have their source
among the mountains. A river, named Thermodon, which
receives the water of all these rivers, traverses the plain.</p>

<p>Another river very similar to this, of the name of Iris,<a name="FNanchor_1145" id="FNanchor_1145"></a><a href="#Footnote_1145" class="fnanchor">1145</a>
flowing from a place called Phanar&#339;a,<a name="FNanchor_1146" id="FNanchor_1146"></a><a href="#Footnote_1146" class="fnanchor">1146</a> traverses the same plain.
It has its sources in Pontus. Flowing westward through the
city of Pontic Comana,<a name="FNanchor_1147" id="FNanchor_1147"></a><a href="#Footnote_1147" class="fnanchor">1147</a> and through Dazimonitis,<a name="FNanchor_1148" id="FNanchor_1148"></a><a href="#Footnote_1148" class="fnanchor">1148</a> a fertile
plain, it then turns to the north beside Gaziura,<a name="FNanchor_1149" id="FNanchor_1149"></a><a href="#Footnote_1149" class="fnanchor">1149</a> an ancient
seat of the kings, but now deserted; it then again returns to
the east, where, uniting with the Scylax<a name="FNanchor_1150" id="FNanchor_1150"></a><a href="#Footnote_1150" class="fnanchor">1150</a> and other rivers,
and taking its course beside the walls of my native place,
Amaseia,<a name="FNanchor_1151" id="FNanchor_1151"></a><a href="#Footnote_1151" class="fnanchor">1151</a> a very strongly fortified city, proceeds to Phanar&#339;a.
There when joined by the Lycus,<a name="FNanchor_1152" id="FNanchor_1152"></a><a href="#Footnote_1152" class="fnanchor">1152</a> which rises in Armenia, it
becomes the Iris. It then enters Themiscyra, and discharges
itself into the Euxine. This plain, therefore, is well
watered with dews, is constantly covered with herbage, and
is capable of affording food to herds of cattle as well as to
horses. The largest crops there consist of panic and millet,
or rather they never fail, for the supply of water more than
counteracts the effect of all drought; these people, therefore,
never on any occasion experience a famine. The country at
the foot of the mountains produces so large an autumnal crop
of spontaneous-grown wild fruits, of the vine, the pear, the
apple, and hazel, that, in all seasons of the year, persons who
go into the woods to cut timber gather them in large quantities;
the fruit is found either yet hanging upon the trees or
lying beneath a deep covering of fallen leaves thickly strewed
upon the ground. Wild animals of all kinds, which resort
here on account of the abundance of food, are frequently
hunted.</p>

<p>16. Next to Themiscyra is Sidene, a fertile plain, but not
watered in the same manner by rivers as Themiscyra. It has
strongholds on the sea-coast, as Side,<a name="FNanchor_1153" id="FNanchor_1153"></a><a href="#Footnote_1153" class="fnanchor">1153</a> from which Sidene has
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]<br />[CAS. 548]</a></span>
its name, Chabaca and Phabda (Phauda).<a name="FNanchor_1154" id="FNanchor_1154"></a><a href="#Footnote_1154" class="fnanchor">1154</a> Amisene extends
as far as this place.</p>

<p>Among the natives of Amisus<a name="FNanchor_1155" id="FNanchor_1155"></a><a href="#Footnote_1155" class="fnanchor">1155</a> distinguished for their learning
were the mathematicians Demetrius, the son of Rathenus,
and Dionysodorus, of the same name as the Ionian (Milesian?)
geometrician, and Tyrannion the grammarian, whose lessons
I attended.</p>

<p>17. Next to Sidene is Pharnacia<a name="FNanchor_1156" id="FNanchor_1156"></a><a href="#Footnote_1156" class="fnanchor">1156</a> a small fortified city, and
then follows Trapezus,<a name="FNanchor_1157" id="FNanchor_1157"></a><a href="#Footnote_1157" class="fnanchor">1157</a> a Greek city, to which from Amisus
is a voyage of about 2200 stadia; thence to the Phasis
about 1400 stadia, so that the sum total of stadia from the
Hieron<a name="FNanchor_1158" id="FNanchor_1158"></a><a href="#Footnote_1158" class="fnanchor">1158</a> to the Phasis is about 8000 stadia, either more or less.</p>

<p>In sailing along this coast from Amisus we first come to
the Heracleian promontory;<a name="FNanchor_1159" id="FNanchor_1159"></a><a href="#Footnote_1159" class="fnanchor">1159</a> then succeeds another promontory,
Jasonium,<a name="FNanchor_1160" id="FNanchor_1160"></a><a href="#Footnote_1160" class="fnanchor">1160</a> and the Genetes;<a name="FNanchor_1161" id="FNanchor_1161"></a><a href="#Footnote_1161" class="fnanchor">1161</a> then Cytorus (Cotyorus) a
small city,<a name="FNanchor_1162" id="FNanchor_1162"></a><a href="#Footnote_1162" class="fnanchor">1162</a> from which Pharnacia received a colony; then
Ischopolis, which is in ruins. Next is a bay on which are
situated Cerasus, and Hermonassa,<a name="FNanchor_1163" id="FNanchor_1163"></a><a href="#Footnote_1163" class="fnanchor">1163</a> small settlements. Near
Hermonassa is Trapezus, then Colchis. Somewhere about
this place is a settlement called Zygopolis.</p>

<p>I have already spoken of Colchis, and of the sea-coast beyond.<a name="FNanchor_1164" id="FNanchor_1164"></a><a href="#Footnote_1164" class="fnanchor">1164</a></p>

<p>18. Above Trapezus and Pharnacia are situated Tibareni,
Chald&aelig;i, Sanni, (who were formerly called Macrones,<a name="FNanchor_1165" id="FNanchor_1165"></a><a href="#Footnote_1165" class="fnanchor">1165</a>) and
the Lesser Armenia. The Appa&iuml;t&aelig; also, formerly called
Cercit&aelig;, are not far from these places. Through the country belonging
to these people stretches the Scydises,<a name="FNanchor_1166" id="FNanchor_1166"></a><a href="#Footnote_1166" class="fnanchor">1166</a> a very rugged
mountain, contiguous to the Moschic mountains<a name="FNanchor_1167" id="FNanchor_1167"></a><a href="#Footnote_1167" class="fnanchor">1167</a> above Colchis.
The heights of the Scydises are occupied by the Heptacomet&aelig;.<a name="FNanchor_1168" id="FNanchor_1168"></a><a href="#Footnote_1168" class="fnanchor">1168</a>
This country is likewise traversed by the Paryadres,<a name="FNanchor_1169" id="FNanchor_1169"></a><a href="#Footnote_1169" class="fnanchor">1169</a> which
extends from the neighbourhood of Sidene and Themiscyra to
the Lesser Armenia, and forms the eastern side of the Pontus.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span></p>

<p>All the inhabitants of these mountains are quite savage,
but the Heptacomet&aelig; are more so than all the others. Some
of them live among trees, or in small towers, whence the
ancients called them Mosyn&#339;ci,<a name="FNanchor_1170" id="FNanchor_1170"></a><a href="#Footnote_1170" class="fnanchor">1170</a> because the towers were
called mos&#563;nes. Their food consists of the flesh of wild animals
and the fruits of trees. They attack travellers, leaping
down from the floors of their dwellings among the trees. The
Heptacomet&aelig; cut off three of Pompey&#8217;s cohorts, as they were
passing through the mountains, by placing on their road
vessels filled with maddening honey, which is procured from
the branches of trees. The men who had tasted the honey
and lost their senses were attacked and easily despatched.
Some of these barbarians were called Byzeres.</p>

<p>19. The present Chald&aelig;i were anciently called Chalybes.
It is in their territory chiefly that Pharnacia is situated. On
the sea-coast it has natural advantages for the capture of the
pelamydes. For this fish is first caught at this place. On
the mainland there are at present mines of iron; formerly
there were also mines of silver. The sea-shore along all these
places is very narrow, for directly above it are hills, which
abound with mines and forests; much, however, of the country
is not cultivated. The miners derive their subsistence from
the mines, and the fishermen from the fisheries, especially
from the capture of pelamydes and dolphins. The dolphins
pursue shoals of fish, the cordyla, the tunny, and even the
pelamys; they grow fat on them, and as they approach the
land incautiously, are easily taken. They are caught with a
bait and then cut into pieces; large quantities of the fat are
used for all purposes.</p>

<p>20. These I suppose are the people who are called by
Homer Halizoni, who in his Catalogue follow the Paphlagonians.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;But Odius and Epistrophus led the Halizoni</div>
<div class="line">Far from Alybe, where there are silver mines;&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1171" id="FNanchor_1171"></a><a href="#Footnote_1171" class="fnanchor">1171</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>whether the writing was changed from &#8220;far from Chalybe,&#8221;
or whether the people were formerly called Alybes instead of
Chalybes. We cannot at present say that it is possible that
Chald&aelig;i should be read for Chalybes, but it cannot be maintained
that formerly Chalybes could not be read for Alybes, especially
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]<br />[CAS. 549]</a></span>
when we know that names are subject to many changes,
more especially among barbarians. For example, a tribe of
Thracians were called Sinties, then Sinti, then Saii, in whose
country Archilochus is said to have thrown away his shield:</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;one of the Saii exults in having a shield, which, without blame, I involuntarily
left behind in a thicket.&#8221;</p>

<p>This same people have now the name of Sap&aelig;i. For all
these people were settled about Abdera, they also held Lemnos
and the islands about Lemnos. Thus also Brygi, Briges,
and Phryges are the same people; and Mysi, M&aelig;ones, and
Meones are the same people. But it is unnecessary to multiply
instances of this kind.</p>

<p>The Scepsian (Demetrius) throws some doubt on the alteration
of the name from Alybes to Chalybes, but not understanding
what follows, nor what accords with it, nor, in particular,
why the poet calls the Chalybes Alizoni, he rejects
the opinion that there has been an alteration of name. In
comparing his opinion with my own I shall consider also the
hypotheses entertained by others.</p>

<p>21. Some persons alter the word to Alazones, others to
Amazons, and &#8220;Alybe&#8221; to &#8220;Alope,&#8221; or &#8220;Alobe,&#8221; calling
the Scythians above the Borysthenes Alazones and Callipid&aelig;,
and by other names, about which Hellanicus, Herodotus, and
Eudoxus have talked very absurdly; some say that the Amazons
were situated between Mysia, Caria, and Lydia near
Cyme, which is the opinion also of Ephorus, who was a native
of the latter place. And this opinion may not be unreasonable,
for he may mean the country which in later times was
inhabited by the &AElig;olians and Ionians, but formerly by Amazons.
There are some cities, it is said, which have their
names from the Amazons; as Ephesus, Smyrna, Cyme, and
Myrina. But would any one think of inquiring in these
places after Alybe, or, according to some writers, Alope, or
Alobe; what would be the meaning of &#8220;from afar,&#8221; or where
is the silver mine?</p>

<p>22. These objections he solves by an alteration in the text,
for he writes the verses in this manner,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;But Odius and Epistrophus led the Amazons,</div>
<div class="line">Who came from Alope, whence the tribe of the Amazonides.&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But by this solution he has invented another fiction. For
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
Alope is nowhere to be found in that situation, and the alteration
in the text, itself a great change, and contrary to the
authority of ancient copies, looks like an adaptation formed
for the occasion.</p>

<p>The Scepsian (Demetrius) does not adopt the opinion of
Ephorus, nor does he agree with those who suppose them to
be the Halizoni about Pallene, whom we mentioned in the description
of Macedonia. He is at a loss also to understand
how any one could suppose that auxiliaries could come to the
Trojans from the Nomades situated above the Borysthenes.
He much approves of the opinion of Hecat&aelig;us the Milesian,
and of Menecrates of Elea, disciples of Xenocrates, and that
of Pal&aelig;phatus. The first of these says in his work entitled
&#8220;the Circuit of the Earth,&#8221; &#8220;near the city Alazia is the river
Odrysses, which after flowing through the plain of Mygdonia
from the west, out of the lake Dascylitis, empties itself into
the Rhyndacus.&#8221; He further relates that Alazia is now deserted,
but that many villages of the Alazones through which
the Odrysses flows are inhabited. In these villages Apollo
is worshipped with peculiar honours, and especially on the
confines of the Cyziceni.</p>

<p>Menecrates, in his work &#8220;the Circuit of the Hellespont,&#8221;
says that above the places near Myrleia there is a continuous
mountain tract occupied by the nation of the Halizoni. The
name, he says, ought to be written with two l&#8217;s, Hallizoni,
but the poet uses one only on account of the metre.</p>

<p>Pal&aelig;phatus says that Odius and Epistrophus levied their
army from among the Amazons then living in Alope, but at
present in Zeleia.<a name="FNanchor_1172" id="FNanchor_1172"></a><a href="#Footnote_1172" class="fnanchor">1172</a></p>

<p>Do the opinions of these persons deserve approbation? For
besides their alteration of the ancient text, and the position of
this people, they neither point out the silver mines, nor where
in Myrleatis Alope is situated, nor how they, who came
thence to Troy, came &#8220;from afar,&#8221; although it should be
granted that there existed an Alope, or an Alazia. For these
are much nearer Troy than the places about Ephesus. Those,
however, are triflers, in the opinion of Demetrius, who speak of
the existence of Amazons near Pygela, between Ephesus,
Magnesia, and Priene, for the words &#8220;from afar&#8221; do not
agree with the spot; much less will they agree with a situation
about Mysia, and Teuthrania.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]<br />[CAS. 551]</a></span></p>

<p>23. This may be true, says he, but some expressions are to
be understood as loosely applied, such as these,</p>

<p>But admitting this, the other assertions are not to be allowed
to which Demetrius is disposed to attend; nor has he refuted
in a convincing manner those persons who maintain that we
ought to read &#8220;far from Chalybe.&#8221; For having conceded
that, although at present there are not silver mines among the
Chalybes, they might formerly have existed, he does not
grant that they were far-famed, and worthy of notice, like
the iron mines. But some one may say, what should prevent
them from being as famous as the iron mines, or does an
abundance of iron make a place celebrated, and not an abundance
of silver? Again, if the silver mines had obtained
celebrity in the age of Homer, but not in the heroic times, can
any one blame the poet&#8217;s representation? How did their fame
reach him? How did the fame of the copper mines at Temesa
in Italy, or of the wealth of Thebes in Egypt, reach his ears,
although Egyptian Thebes was situated almost at double the
distance of the Chald&aelig;i.</p>

<p>But Demetrius does not altogether agree with those whose
opinions he espouses. For when he is describing the neighbourhood
of Scepsis his own birth-place, he mentions Enea, a
village, Argyria, and Alazonia, as near Scepsis, and the &AElig;sepus;<a name="FNanchor_1176" id="FNanchor_1176"></a><a href="#Footnote_1176" class="fnanchor">1176</a>
but if these places exist at all, they must be near the sources of
the &AElig;sepus. Hecat&aelig;us places them beyond the mouths of that
river. Pal&aelig;phatus, who says that the Amazons formerly occupied
Alope, and at present Zeleia, does not advance anything
in agreement with these statements. But if Menecrates
agrees with Demetrius, neither does Menecrates say what this
Alope, or Alobe, is, (or, in whatever manner they please to
write the name,) nor yet does Demetrius himself.</p>

<p>24. With regard to Apollodorus, who mentions these places
in his discourse on the array of the Trojan forces, we have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
said much before in reply to him, and we must now speak of
him again.<a name="FNanchor_1177" id="FNanchor_1177"></a><a href="#Footnote_1177" class="fnanchor">1177</a> He is of opinion that we ought not to understand
the Halizoni without the Halys, for no auxiliaries came to
Troy from the country on the other side of the Halys.
First, then, we will inquire of him who are the Halizoni
within the Halys, and situated</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;far from Alybe, where are silver mines?&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>He will not be able to reply. Next we will ask the reason
why he does not admit that some auxiliaries came from the
country on the other side of the Halys. For if it was the
case, that all the rest were living on this side the Halys, except
the Thracians, nothing prevented this one body of allies
from coming from afar, from the country beyond the Leuco-Syrians?
Or, was it possible for the persons immediately
engaged in the war to pass over from those places, and from
the country beyond them, as the Amazons, Treres, and Cimmerians,
but impossible for allies to do so?</p>

<p>The Amazons were not allies, because Priam had fought in
alliance with the Phrygians against them:</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;at that time, says Priam, I was among their auxiliaries on that day,
when the Amazons came to attack them.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1178" id="FNanchor_1178"></a><a href="#Footnote_1178" class="fnanchor">1178</a></p>

<p>The people also who were living on the borders of the
country of the Amazons were not situated at so great a distance
that it was difficult to send for them from thence, nor
did any animosity exist, I suppose, at that time to prevent
them from affording assistance.</p>

<p>25. Nor is there any foundation for the opinion, that all the
ancients agree that no people from the country beyond the
Halys took part in the Trojan war. Testimony may be
found to the contrary. M&aelig;andrius at least says that Heneti
came from the country of the Leuco-Syrians to assist the Trojans
in the war; that they set sail thence with the Thracians,
and settled about the recess of the Adriatic; and that the
Heneti, who had no place in the expedition, were Cappadocians.
This account seems to agree with the circumstance, that the
people inhabiting the whole of that part of Cappadocia near the
Halys, which extends along Paphlagonia, speak two dialects,
and that their language abounds with Paphlagonian names, as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]<br />[CAS. 553]</a></span>
Bagas, Biasas, &AElig;niates, Rhatotes, Zardoces, Tibius, Gasys,
Oligasys, and Manes. For these names are frequently to be
found in the Bamonitis, the Pimolitis, the Gazalu&iuml;tis, and
Gazacene, and in most of the other districts. Apollodorus
himself quotes the words of Homer, altered by Zenodotus;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;from Henete, whence comes a race of wild mules,&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>and says, that Hecat&aelig;us the Milesian understands Henete to
mean Amisus. But we have shown that Amisus belongs to
the Leuco-Syrians, and is situated beyond the Halys.</p>

<p>26. He also somewhere says that the poet obtained his
knowledge of the Paphlagonians, situated in the interior, from
persons who had travelled through the country on foot, but
that he was not acquainted with the sea-coast any more than
with the rest of the territory of Pontus; for otherwise he
would have mentioned it by name. We may, on the contrary,
after the description which has just been given of the
country, retort and say that he has traversed the whole of the
sea-coast, and has omitted nothing worthy of record which
existed at that time. It is not surprising that he does not
mention Heracleia, Amastris, or Sinope, for they were not
founded; nor is it strange that he should omit to speak of
the interior of the country; nor is it a proof of ignorance
not to specify by name many places which were well known,
as we have shown in a preceding part of this work.</p>

<p>He says that Homer was ignorant of much that was remarkable
in Pontus, as rivers and nations, otherwise he would
have mentioned their names. This may be admitted with
respect to some very remarkable nations and rivers, as the
Scythians, the Palus M&aelig;otis, and the Danube. For he would
not have described the Nomades, by characteristic signs, as
living on milk, Abii, a people without certain means of subsistence,
&#8220;most just&#8221; and &#8220;renowned Hippemolgi,&#8221; (milkers
of mares,) and not distinguished them as Scythians, or Sauromat&aelig;,
or Sarmat&aelig;, if, indeed, they had these names among
the Greeks (at that time). Nor in mentioning the Thracians
and Mysians, who live near the Danube, would he have
passed over in silence the Danube itself, one of the largest
rivers, particularly as, in other instances, he is inclined to
mark the boundaries of places by rivers; nor in speaking of
the Cimmerians would he have omitted the Bosporus, or the
M&aelig;otis.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span></p>

<p>27. With respect then to places not so remarkable, or not
famous at that time, or not illustrating the subject of his poem,
who can blame the poet for omitting them? As, for example,
omitting to mention the Don, famed only as it is for being the
boundary of Asia and Europe. The persons however of that
time were not accustomed to use the name either of Asia or
Europe, nor was the habitable earth divided into three continents;
otherwise he would have mentioned them by name on
account of their strong characteristic marks, as he mentioned
by name Libya (Africa), and the Libs (the south-west wind),
blowing from the western parts of Africa. But as the continents
were not yet distinguished, it was not necessary that he
should mention the Don. There were many things worthy of
record, which did not occur to him. For both in actions and
in discourse much is done and said without any cause or motive,
by merely spontaneously presenting itself to the mind.</p>

<p>It is evident from all these circumstances that every person
who concludes that because a certain thing is not mentioned
by the poet he was therefore ignorant of it, uses a bad argument;
and we must prove by several examples that it is bad,
for many persons employ this kind of evidence to a great
extent. We must refute them therefore by producing such
instances as these which follow, although we shall repeat what
has been already said.</p>

<p>If any one should maintain that the poet was not acquainted
with a river which he has not mentioned, we should say that
his argument is absurd, for he has not mentioned by name even
the river Meles, which runs by Smyrna, his birth-place according
to many writers, while he has mentioned the rivers
Hermus and Hyllus by name, but yet not the Pactolus,<a name="FNanchor_1179" id="FNanchor_1179"></a><a href="#Footnote_1179" class="fnanchor">1179</a> which
discharges itself into the same channel as these rivers, and
rises in the mountain Tmolus.<a name="FNanchor_1180" id="FNanchor_1180"></a><a href="#Footnote_1180" class="fnanchor">1180</a> He does not mention either
Smyrna itself, or the other cities of the Ionians, or most of those
of the &AElig;olians, although he specifies Miletus, Samos, Lesbos,
and Tenedos. He does not mention the Leth&aelig;us, which flows
beside Magnesia,<a name="FNanchor_1181" id="FNanchor_1181"></a><a href="#Footnote_1181" class="fnanchor">1181</a> nor the Marsyas, which rivers empty themselves
into the M&aelig;ander,<a name="FNanchor_1182" id="FNanchor_1182"></a><a href="#Footnote_1182" class="fnanchor">1182</a> which he mentions by name, as well as</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]<br />[CAS. 554]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;the Rhesus, Heptaporus, Caresus, and Rhodius,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1183" id="FNanchor_1183"></a><a href="#Footnote_1183" class="fnanchor">1183</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>and others, many of which are not more than small streams.
While he specifies by name many countries and cities, sometimes
he makes an enumeration of rivers and mountains,
sometimes he does not do so. He does not mention the rivers
in &AElig;tolia and Attica, nor many others. And if, in mentioning
people that live afar off, he does not mention those who are
very near, it is certainly not through ignorance of them, for
they were well known to other writers. With respect to people
who were all equally near, he does not observe one rule,
for some he mentions, and not others, as for instance he mentions
the Lycii, and Solymi, but not the Mily&aelig;, nor Pamphylians,
nor Pisidians; the Paphlagonians, Phrygians, and Mysians,
but not the Mariandyni, nor Thyni, nor Bithynians, nor Bebryces;
the Amazons, but not the Leuco-Syrians, nor Syrians,
nor Cappadocians, nor Lycaonians, while he frequently speaks
of the Ph&#339;nicians, &AElig;gyptians, and &AElig;thiopians. He mentions
the Aleian plain, and the Arimi mountains, but not the
nation among which these are situated.</p>

<p>The argument drawn from this is false; the true argument
would have been to show that the poet has asserted what is
not true. Apollodorus has not succeeded in this attempt, and
he has more particularly failed when he ventures to call by the
name of fiction &#8220;the renowned Hippemolgi and Galactophagi.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1184" id="FNanchor_1184"></a><a href="#Footnote_1184" class="fnanchor">1184</a>
So much then in reply to Apollodorus. I now return to the
part of my description which follows next in order.</p>

<p>28. Above the places about Pharnacia and Trapezus are
the Tibareni, and Chald&aelig;i, extending as far as the Lesser
Armenia.</p>

<p>The Lesser Armenia is sufficiently fertile. Like Sophene
it was always governed by princes who were sometimes in
alliance with the other Armenians, and sometimes acting independently.
They held in subjection the Chald&aelig;i and Tibareni.
Their dominion extended as far as Trapezus and Pharnacia.
When Mithridates Eupator became powerful, he made himself
master of Colchis, and of all those places which were ceded to
him by Antipater the son of Sisis. He bestowed however so
much care upon them, that he built seventy-five strongholds,
in which he deposited the greatest part of his treasure. The
most considerable of these were Hydara, Basg&#339;dariza, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
Sinoria, a fortress situated on the borders of the Greater Armenia,
whence Theophanes parodied the name, and called it
Synoria.</p>

<p>All the mountainous range of the Paryadres has many such
convenient situations for fortresses, being well supplied with
water and timber, it is intersected in many places by abrupt
ravines and precipices. Here he built most of the strongholds
for keeping his treasure. At last on the invasion of the
country by Pompey he took refuge in these extreme parts of
the kingdom of Pontus, and occupied a mountain near Dasteira
in Acilisene, which was well supplied with water. The
Euphrates also was near, which is the boundary between Acilisene
and the Lesser Armenia. Mithridates remained there
till he was besieged and compelled to fly across the mountains
into Colchis, and thence to Bosporus. Pompey built near this
same place in the Lesser Armenia Nicopolis, a city which yet
subsists, and is well inhabited.</p>

<p>29. The Lesser Armenia, which was in the possession of
different persons at different times, according to the pleasure
of the Romans, was at last subject to Archelaus. The Tibareni,
however, and Chald&aelig;i, extending as far as Colchis, Pharnacia,
and Trapezus, are under the government of Pythodoris,
a prudent woman, and capable of presiding over the management
of public affairs. She is the daughter of Pythodorus of
Tralles. She was the wife of Polemo, and reigned conjointly
with him for some time. She succeeded, after his
death, to the throne. He died in the country of the Aspurgiani,
a tribe of barbarians living about Sindica. She had
two sons by Polemo, and a daughter who was married to
Cotys the Sap&aelig;an. He was treacherously murdered, and she
became a widow. She had children by him, the eldest of whom
is now king. Of the sons of Pythodoris, one as a private
person, administers, together with his mother, the affairs of
the kingdom, the other has been lately made king of the
Greater Armenia. Pythodoris however married Archelaus,
and remained with him till his death. At present she is a
widow, and in possession of the countries before mentioned,
and of others still more beautiful, of which we shall next speak.</p>

<p>30. Sidene, and Themiscyra are contiguous to Pharnacia.
Above these countries is situated Phanar&#339;a, containing the
best portion of the Pontus, for it produces excellent oil and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]<br />[CAS. 556]</a></span>
wine, and possesses every other property of a good soil. On
the eastern side it lies in front of the Paryadres which
runs parallel to it; on the western side it has the Lithrus,
and the Ophlimus. It forms a valley of considerable length
and breadth. The Lycus, coming out of Armenia, flows
through this valley, and the Iris, which issues from the passes
near Amaseia. Both these rivers unite about the middle
of the valley. A city stands at their confluence which the
first founder called Eupatoria, after his own name. Pompey
found it half-finished, and added to it a territory, furnished
it with inhabitants, and called it Magnopolis. It lies in the
middle of the plain. Close to the foot of the Paryadres is
situated Cabeira, about 150 stadia further to the south than
Magnopolis, about which distance likewise, but towards the
west, is Amaseia. At Cabeira was the palace of Mithridates,
the water-mill, the park for keeping wild animals, the hunting-ground
in the neighbourhood, and the mines.</p>

<p>31. There also is the Cainochorion, (New Castle,) as it is
called, a fortified and precipitous rock, distant from Cabeira
less than 200 stadia. On its summit is a spring, which throws
up abundance of water, and at its foot a river, and a deep ravine.
The ridge of rocks on which it stands is of very great height,
so that it cannot be taken by siege. It is enclosed with an excellent
wall, except the part where it has been demolished by
the Romans. The whole country around is so covered with
wood, so mountainous, and destitute of water, that an enemy
cannot encamp within the distance of 120 stadia. There
Mithridates had deposited his most valuable effects, which are
now in the Capitol, as offerings dedicated by Pompey.</p>

<p>Pythodoris is in possession of all this country; (for it is contiguous
to that of the barbarians, which she holds as a conquered
country;) she also holds the Zelitis and the Megalopolitis.
After Pompey had raised Cabeira to the rank of a city, and
called it Diospolis, Pythodoris improved it still more, changed
its name to Sebaste, (or Augusta,) and considers it a royal city.</p>

<p>She has also the temple of M&#275;n surnamed of Pharnaces, at
Ameria, a village city, inhabited by a large body of sacred
menials, and having annexed to it a sacred territory, the produce
of which is always enjoyed by the priest. The kings
held this temple in such exceeding veneration, that this was
the Royal oath, &#8220;by the fortune of the king, and by M&#275;n of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
Pharnaces.&#8221; This is also the temple of the moon, like that
among the Albani, and those in Phrygia, namely the temple of
M&#275;n in a place of the same name, the temple of Asc&aelig;us at
Antioch in Pisidia, and another in the territory of Antioch.</p>

<p>32. Above Phanar&#339;a is Comana<a name="FNanchor_1185" id="FNanchor_1185"></a><a href="#Footnote_1185" class="fnanchor">1185</a> in Pontus, of the same
name as that in the Greater Cappadocia, and dedicated to the
same goddess. The temple is a copy of that in Cappadocia,
and nearly the same course of religious rites is practised there;
the mode of delivering the oracles is the same; the same respect
is paid to the priests, as was more particularly the case in the
time of the first kings, when twice a year, at what is called the
Exodi of the goddess, (when her image is carried in procession,)
the priest wore the diadem of the goddess and received the
chief honours after the king.</p>

<p>33. We have formerly mentioned Dorylaus the Tactician,
who was my mother&#8217;s great grandfather; and another Dorylaus,
who was the nephew of the former, and the son of Philet&aelig;rus;
I said that, although he had obtained from Mithridates the
highest dignities and even the priesthood of Comana, he was
detected in the fact of attempting the revolt of the kingdom
to the Romans. Upon his fall the family also was disgraced.
At a later period however Moaphernes, my mother&#8217;s uncle, rose
to distinction near upon the dissolution of the kingdom. But a
second time he and his friends shared in the misfortunes of
the king, except those persons who had anticipated the calamity
and deserted him early. This was the case with my
maternal grandfather, who, perceiving the unfortunate progress
of the affairs of the king in the war with Lucullus, and at the
same time being alienated from him by resentment for having
lately put to death his nephew Tibius, and his son Theophilus,
undertook to avenge their wrongs and his own. He obtained
pledges of security from Lucullus, and caused fifteen fortresses
to revolt; in return he received magnificent promises. On
the arrival of Pompey, who succeeded Lucullus in the conduct
of the war, he regarded as enemies (in consequence of the
enmity which subsisted between himself and that general) all
those persons who had performed any services that were acceptable
to Lucullus. On his return home at the conclusion
of the war he prevailed upon the senate not to confirm those
honours which Lucullus had promised to some persons of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]<br />[CAS. 558]</a></span>
Pontus, maintaining it to be unjust towards a general who had
brought the war to a successful issue, that the rewards and distribution
of honours should be placed in the hands of another.</p>

<p>34. The affairs of Comana were administered as has been
described in the time of the kings. Pompey, when he had obtained
the power, appointed Archelaus priest, and assigned to
him a district of two sch&#339;ni, or 60 stadia in circuit, in addition
to the sacred territory, and gave orders to the inhabitants
to obey Archelaus. He was their governor, and master of the
sacred slaves who inhabited the city, but had not the power of
selling them. The slaves amounted to no less than six thousand.</p>

<p>This Archelaus was the son of that Archelaus who received
honours from Sylla and the senate; he was the friend of
Gabinius, a person of consular rank. When the former was
sent into Syria, he came with the expectation of accompanying
him, when he was making preparations for the Parthian war,
but the senate would not permit him to do so, and he abandoned
this, and conceived a greater design.</p>

<p>Ptolemy, the father of Cleopatra, happened at this time to be
ejected from his kingdom by the &AElig;gyptians. His daughter
however, the elder sister of Cleopatra, was in possession of the
throne. When inquiries were making in order to marry her to
a husband of royal descent, Archelaus presented himself to
those who were negotiating the affair, and pretended to be
the son of Mithridates Eupator. He was accepted, but reigned
only six months. He was killed by Gabinius in a pitched
battle, in his attempt to restore Ptolemy.</p>

<p>35. His son however succeeded to the priesthood, and Lycomedes
succeeded him, to whom was assigned an additional
district of four sch&#339;ni (or 120 stadia) in extent. When Lycomedes
was dispossessed he was succeeded by Dyteutus, the
son of Adiatorix, who still occupies the post, and appears to
have obtained this honour from C&aelig;sar Augustus on account of
his good conduct on the following occasion.</p>

<p>C&aelig;sar, after leading in triumph Adiatorix, with his wife and
children, had resolved to put him to death together with the
eldest of his sons. Dyteutus was the eldest; but when the
second of his brothers told the soldiers who were leading them
away to execution that he was the eldest, there was a contest
between the two brothers, which continued for some time, till
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
the parents prevailed upon Dyteutus to yield to the younger,
assigning as a reason, that the eldest would be a better person
to protect his mother and his remaining brother. The younger
was put to death together with his father; the elder was saved,
and obtained this office. When C&aelig;sar was informed of the
execution of these persons, he regretted it, and, considering
the survivors worthy of his favour and protection, bestowed
upon them this honourable appointment.</p>

<p>36. Comana is populous, and is a considerable mart, frequented
by persons coming from Armenia. Men and women
assemble there from all quarters from the cities and the country
to celebrate the festival at the time of the exodi or processions
of the goddess. Some persons under the obligation of a vow
are always residing there, and perform sacrifices in honour
of the goddess.</p>

<p>The inhabitants are voluptuous in their mode of life. All
their property is planted with vines, and there is a multitude
of women, who make a gain of their persons, most of whom
are dedicated to the goddess. The city is almost a little
Corinth. On account of the multitude of harlots at Corinth,
who are dedicated to Venus, and attracted by the festivities of
the place, strangers resorted thither in great numbers. Merchants
and soldiers were quite ruined, so that hence the proverb
originated,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;every man cannot go to Corinth.&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Such is the character of Comana.</p>

<p>37. All the country around is subject to Pythodoris, and
she possesses also Phanar&#339;a, the Zelitis, and the Megalopolitis.</p>

<p>We have already spoken of Phanar&#339;a.</p>

<p>In the district Zelitis is the city Zela,<a name="FNanchor_1186" id="FNanchor_1186"></a><a href="#Footnote_1186" class="fnanchor">1186</a> built upon the mound
of Semiramis. It contains the temple of Ana&iuml;tis, whom the
Armenians also worship. Sacrifices are performed with more
pomp than in other places, and all the people of Pontus take
oaths here in affairs of highest concern. The multitude
of the sacred menials, and the honours conferred upon the
priests, were in the time of the kings, upon the plan which I
have before described. At present, however, everything is
under the power of Pythodoris, but many persons had previously
reduced the number of the sacred attendants, injured
the property and diminished the revenue belonging to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]<br />[CAS. 560]</a></span>
temple. The adjacent district of Zelitis, (in which is the
city Zela, on the mound of Semiramis,) was reduced by being
divided into several governments. Anciently, the kings did
not govern Zela as a city, but regarded it as a temple of the
Persian gods; the priest was the director of everything relating
to its administration. It was inhabited by a multitude
of sacred menials, by the priest, who possessed great wealth,
and by his numerous attendants; the sacred territory was
under the authority of the priest, and it was his own property.
Pompey added many provinces to Zelitis, and gave the name
of city to Zela, as well as to Megalopolis. He formed Zelitis,
Culupene, and Camisene, into one district. The two latter
bordered upon the Lesser Armenia, and upon Laviansene.
Fossile salt was found in them, and there was an ancient
fortress called Camisa, at present in ruins. The Roman governors
who next succeeded assigned one portion of these two
governments to the priests of Comana, another to the priest of
Zela, and another to Ateporix, a chief of the family of the
tetrarchs of Galatia; upon his death, this portion, which was
not large, became subject to the Romans under the name of a
province. This little state is a political body of itself, Carana<a name="FNanchor_1187" id="FNanchor_1187"></a><a href="#Footnote_1187" class="fnanchor">1187</a>
being united with it as a colony, and hence the district has the
name of Caranitis. The other parts are in the possession of
Pythodoris, and Dyteutus.</p>

<p>38. There remain to be described the parts of Pontus,
situated between this country and the districts of Amisus, and
Sinope, extending towards Cappadocia, the Galatians, and the
Paphlagonians.</p>

<p>Next to the territory of the Amiseni is Phazemonitis,<a name="FNanchor_1188" id="FNanchor_1188"></a><a href="#Footnote_1188" class="fnanchor">1188</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
which extends as far as the Halys, and which Pompey called
Neapolitis. He raised the village Phazemon to the rank of a
city, and increasing its extent gave to it the name of Neapolis.<a name="FNanchor_1189" id="FNanchor_1189"></a><a href="#Footnote_1189" class="fnanchor">1189</a>
The northern side of this tract is bounded by the Gazelonitis,
and by the country of the Amiseni; the western side
by the Halys; the eastern by Phanar&#339;a; the remainder by
the territory of Amasis, my native country, which surpasses all
the rest in extent and fertility.</p>

<p>The part of Phazemonitis towards Phanar&#339;a is occupied by
a lake, sea-like in magnitude, called Stiphane,<a name="FNanchor_1190" id="FNanchor_1190"></a><a href="#Footnote_1190" class="fnanchor">1190</a> which abounds
with fish, and has around it a large range of pasture adapted
to all kinds of animals. Close upon it is a strong fortress,
Cizari, [Icizari,] at present deserted, and near it a royal seat
in ruins. The rest of the country in general is bare, but produces
corn.</p>

<p>Above the district of Amasis are the hot springs<a name="FNanchor_1191" id="FNanchor_1191"></a><a href="#Footnote_1191" class="fnanchor">1191</a> of the
Phazemonit&aelig;, highly salubrious, and the Sagylium,<a name="FNanchor_1192" id="FNanchor_1192"></a><a href="#Footnote_1192" class="fnanchor">1192</a> a stronghold
situated on a lofty perpendicular hill, stretching upwards
and terminating in a sharp peak. In this fortress is a reservoir
well supplied with water, which is at present neglected,
but was useful, on many occasions, to the kings. Here the
sons of Pharnaces the king captured and put to death Arsaces,
who was governing without the authority of the Roman generals,
and endeavouring to produce a revolution in the state.
The fortress was taken by Polemo and Lycomedes, both of
them kings, by famine and not by storm. Arsaces, being prevented
from escaping into the plains, fled to the mountains
without provisions. There he found the wells choked up with
large pieces of rock. This had been done by order of Pompey,
who had directed the fortresses to be demolished, and to leave
nothing in them that could be serviceable to robbers, who
might use them as places of refuge. Such was the settlement
of the Phazemonitis made by Pompey. Those who came afterwards
divided this district among various kings.</p>

<p>39. My native city, Amaseia, lies in a deep and extensive
valley, through which runs the river Iris.<a name="FNanchor_1193" id="FNanchor_1193"></a><a href="#Footnote_1193" class="fnanchor">1193</a> It is indebted to
nature and art for its admirable position and construction. It
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]<br />[CAS. 561]</a></span>
answers the double purpose of a city and a fortress. It is a
high rock, precipitous on all sides, descending rapidly down
to the river: on the margin of the river, where the city stands,
is a wall, and a wall also which ascends on each side of the
city to the peaks, of which there are two, united by nature, and
completely fortified with towers. In this circuit of the wall
are the palace, and the monuments of the kings. The peaks
are connected together by a very narrow ridge, in height five
or six stadia on each side, as you ascend from the banks
of the river, and from the suburbs. From the ridge to the
peaks there remains another sharp ascent of a stadium in length,
which defies the attacks of an enemy. Within the rock are
reservoirs of water, the supply from which the inhabitants
cannot be deprived of, as two channels are cut, one in the
direction of the river, the other of the ridge. Two bridges
are built over the river, one leading from the city to the suburbs,
the other from the suburbs to the country beyond; for
near this bridge the mountain, which overhangs the rock, terminates.</p>

<p>A valley extends from the river; it is not very wide at its
commencement, but afterwards increases in breadth, and forms
the plain called the Chiliocomon (The Thousand Villages).
Next is the Diacopene, and the Pimolisene, the whole of which
is a fertile district extending to the Halys.</p>

<p>These are the northern parts of the country of the Amasenses,
and are in length about 500 stadia. Then follows the
remainder, which is much longer, extending as far as Babanomus,
and the Ximene,<a name="FNanchor_1194" id="FNanchor_1194"></a><a href="#Footnote_1194" class="fnanchor">1194</a> which itself reaches to the Halys.
The breadth is reckoned from north to south, to the Zelitis
and the Greater Cappadocia, as far as the Trocmi.<a name="FNanchor_1195" id="FNanchor_1195"></a><a href="#Footnote_1195" class="fnanchor">1195</a> In
Ximene there is found fossile salt, (&#7941;&#955;&#949;&#962;, Hales,) from which
it is supposed the river had the name of Halys. There are
many ruined fortresses in my native country, and large tracts
of land made a desert by the Mithridatic war. The whole of
it, however, abounds with trees. It affords pasture for horses,
and is adapted to the subsistence of other animals; the whole
of it is very habitable. Amaseia was given to the kings, but
at present it is a (Roman) province.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span></p>

<p>40. There remains to be described the country within the
Halys, belonging to the province of Pontus, and situated about
the Olgassys,<a name="FNanchor_1196" id="FNanchor_1196"></a><a href="#Footnote_1196" class="fnanchor">1196</a> and contiguous to the Sinopic district. The Olgassys
is a very lofty mountain, and difficult to be passed. The
Paphlagonians have erected temples in every part of this
mountain. The country around, the Blaene, and the Doman&#299;tis,
through which the river Amnias<a name="FNanchor_1197" id="FNanchor_1197"></a><a href="#Footnote_1197" class="fnanchor">1197</a> runs, is sufficiently
fertile. Here it was that Mithridates Eupator entirely destroyed<a name="FNanchor_1198" id="FNanchor_1198"></a><a href="#Footnote_1198" class="fnanchor">1198</a>
the army of Nicomedes the Bithynian, not in person,
for he himself happened to be absent, but by his generals.
Nicomedes fled with a few followers, and escaped into his own
country, and thence sailed to Italy. Mithridates pursued him,
and made himself master of Bithynia as soon as he entered it,
and obtained possession of Asia as far as Caria and Lycia.
Here is situated Pompeiopolis,<a name="FNanchor_1199" id="FNanchor_1199"></a><a href="#Footnote_1199" class="fnanchor">1199</a> in which city is the Sandaracurgium,<a name="FNanchor_1200" id="FNanchor_1200"></a><a href="#Footnote_1200" class="fnanchor">1200</a>
(or Sandaraca works,) it is not far distant
from Pimolisa, a royal fortress in ruins, from which the country
on each side of the river is called Pimolisene. The Sandaracurgium
is a mountain hollowed out by large trenches
made by workmen in the process of mining. The work is always
carried on at the public charge, and slaves were employed
in the mine who had been sold on account of their crimes.
Besides the great labour of the employment, the air is said to
be destructive of life, and scarcely endurable in consequence of
the strong odour issuing from the masses of mineral; hence
the slaves are short-lived. The mining is frequently suspended
from its becoming unprofitable, for great expense is incurred
by the employment of more than two hundred workmen, whose
number is continually diminishing by disease and fatal accidents.</p>

<p>So much respecting Pontus.</p>

<p>41. Next to Pompeiopolis is the remainder of the inland
parts of Paphlagonia as far as Bithynia towards the west.
This tract, although small in extent, was governed, a little before
our time, by several princes, but their race is extinct; at
present it is in possession of the Romans. The parts bordering
upon Bithynia are called Timonitis; the country of Gezatorix,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]<br />[CAS. 562]</a></span>
Marmolitis, Sanisene, and Potamia. There was also a
Cimiatene, in which was Cimiata, a strong fortress situated
at the foot of the mountainous range of the Olgassys. Mithridates,
surnamed Ctistes, (or the Founder,) made it his
head-quarters when engaged in the conquest of Pontus, and
his successors kept possession of it to the time of Mithridates
Eupator. The last king of Paphlagonia was De&iuml;otarus,<a name="FNanchor_1201" id="FNanchor_1201"></a><a href="#Footnote_1201" class="fnanchor">1201</a> son
of Castor, and surnamed Philadelphus, who possessed Gangra,<a name="FNanchor_1202" id="FNanchor_1202"></a><a href="#Footnote_1202" class="fnanchor">1202</a>
containing the palace of Morzeus, a small town, and a fortress.</p>

<p>42. Eudoxus, without defining the spot, says, that fossil
fish<a name="FNanchor_1203" id="FNanchor_1203"></a><a href="#Footnote_1203" class="fnanchor">1203</a> are found in Paphlagonia in dry ground, and in marshy
ground also about the lake Ascanius,<a name="FNanchor_1204" id="FNanchor_1204"></a><a href="#Footnote_1204" class="fnanchor">1204</a> which is below Cius,
but he gives no clear information on the subject.</p>

<p>We have described Paphlagonia bordering upon Pontus;
and as the Bithynians border upon the Paphlagonians towards
the west, we shall endeavour to describe this region
also. We shall then set out again from the Bithynians and
the Paphlagonians, and describe the parts of the country next
to these nations lying towards the south; they extend as far
as the Taurus, and are parallel to Pontus and Cappadocia;
for some order and division of this kind are suggested by the
nature of the places.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Bithynia</span> is bounded on the east by the Paphlagonians,
Mariandyni, and by some tribes of the Epicteti; on the north
by the line of the sea-coast of the Euxine, extending from the
mouth of the Sangarius<a name="FNanchor_1205" id="FNanchor_1205"></a><a href="#Footnote_1205" class="fnanchor">1205</a> to the straits at Byzantium and Chalcedon;
on the west by the Propontis; on the south by Mysia
and Phrygia Epictetus, as it is called, which has the name also
of Hellespontic Phrygia.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span></p>

<p>2. Here upon the mouth of the Pontus is situated Chalcedon,
founded by the Megareans,<a name="FNanchor_1206" id="FNanchor_1206"></a><a href="#Footnote_1206" class="fnanchor">1206</a> the village Chrysopolis, and
the Chalcedonian temple. In the country a little above the
sea-coast is a fountain, Azaritia, (Azaretia?) which breeds
small crocodiles.</p>

<p>Next follows the coast of the Chalcedonians, the bay of
Astacus,<a name="FNanchor_1207" id="FNanchor_1207"></a><a href="#Footnote_1207" class="fnanchor">1207</a> as it is called, which is a part of the Propontis.</p>

<p>Here Nicomedia<a name="FNanchor_1208" id="FNanchor_1208"></a><a href="#Footnote_1208" class="fnanchor">1208</a> is situated, bearing the name of one of
the Bithynian kings by whom it was founded. Many kings
however have taken the same name, as the Ptolemies, on account
of the fame of the first person who bore it.</p>

<p>On the same bay was Astacus a city founded by Megareans
and Athenians; it was afterwards again colonized by D&#339;dalsus.
The bay had its name from the city. It was razed by
Lysimachus. The founder of Nicomedia transferred its inhabitants
to the latter city.</p>

<p>3. There is another bay<a name="FNanchor_1209" id="FNanchor_1209"></a><a href="#Footnote_1209" class="fnanchor">1209</a> continuous with that of Astacus,
which advances further towards the east, and where is situated
Prusias,<a name="FNanchor_1210" id="FNanchor_1210"></a><a href="#Footnote_1210" class="fnanchor">1210</a> formerly called Cius. Philip, the son of Demetrius,
and father of Perseus, gave it to Prusias, son of
Zelas, who had assisted him in destroying both this and
Myrleia,<a name="FNanchor_1211" id="FNanchor_1211"></a><a href="#Footnote_1211" class="fnanchor">1211</a> a neighbouring city, and also situated near Prusa.
He rebuilt them from their ruins, and called the city Cius
Prusias, after his own name, and Myrleia he called Apameia,
after that of his wife. This is the Prusias who received
Hannibal, (who took refuge with him hither after the defeat
of Antiochus,) and retired from Phrygia<a name="FNanchor_1212" id="FNanchor_1212"></a><a href="#Footnote_1212" class="fnanchor">1212</a> on the Hellespont,
according to agreement with the Attalici.<a name="FNanchor_1213" id="FNanchor_1213"></a><a href="#Footnote_1213" class="fnanchor">1213</a> This
country was formerly called Lesser Phrygia, but by the Attalici
Phrygia Epictetus.<a name="FNanchor_1214" id="FNanchor_1214"></a><a href="#Footnote_1214" class="fnanchor">1214</a> Above Prusias is a mountain which
is called Arganthonius.<a name="FNanchor_1215" id="FNanchor_1215"></a><a href="#Footnote_1215" class="fnanchor">1215</a> Here is the scene of the fable of
Hylas, one of the companions of Hercules in the ship Argo,
who, having disembarked in order to obtain water for the
vessel, was carried away by nymphs. Cius, as the story
goes, was a friend and companion of Hercules; on his return
from Colchis, he settled there and founded the city which
bears his name. At the present time a festival called Oreibasia,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]<br />[CAS. 564]</a></span>
is celebrated by the Prusienses, who wander about the
mountains and woods, a rebel rout, calling on Hylas by name,
as though in search of him.</p>

<p>The Prusienses having shown a friendly disposition towards
the Romans in their administration of public affairs, obtained
their freedom. But the Apamies were obliged to admit a
Roman colony.</p>

<p>Prusa, situated below the Mysian Olympus, on the borders
of the Phrygians and the Mysians, is a well-governed city;
it was founded by Cyrus,<a name="FNanchor_1216" id="FNanchor_1216"></a><a href="#Footnote_1216" class="fnanchor">1216</a> who made war against Cr&#339;sus.</p>

<p>4. It is difficult to define the boundaries of the Bithynians,
Mysians, Phrygians, of the Doliones about Cyzicus, and of the
Mygdones and Troes; it is generally admitted that each of
these tribes ought to be placed apart from the other. A proverbial
saying is applied to the Phrygians and Mysians,</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;The boundaries of the Mysi and Phryges are apart from one another,&#8221;</p>

<p>but it is difficult to define them respectively. The reason is
this; strangers who came into the country were soldiers and
barbarians; they had no fixed settlement in the country of
which they obtained possession, but were, for the most part,
wanderers, expelling others from their territory, and being expelled
themselves. All these nations might be supposed to be
Thracians, because Thracians occupy the country on the other
side, and because they do not differ much from one another.</p>

<p>5. But as far as we are able to conjecture, we may place
Mysia between Bithynia and the mouth of the &AElig;sepus, contiguous
to the sea, and nearly along the whole of Olympus.
Around it, in the interior, is the Epictetus, nowhere reaching
the sea, and extending as far as the eastern parts of the Ascanian
lake and district, for both bear the same name. Part of
this territory was Phrygian, and part Mysian; the Phrygian
was further distant from Troy; and so we must understand
the words of the poet<a name="FNanchor_1217" id="FNanchor_1217"></a><a href="#Footnote_1217" class="fnanchor">1217</a>, when he says,</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;Phorcys, and the godlike Ascanius, were the leaders of the Phryges
far from Ascania,&#8221;</p>

<p>that is, the Phrygian Ascania; for the other, the Mysian
Ascania, was nearer to the present Nic&aelig;a, which he mentions,
when he says,</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span></p>

<p class="small">&#8220;Palmys, Ascanius, and Morys, sons of Hippotion, the leader of the
Mysi, fighting in close combat, who came from the fertile soil of Ascania,
as auxiliaries.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1218" id="FNanchor_1218"></a><a href="#Footnote_1218" class="fnanchor">1218</a></p>

<p>It is not then surprising that he should speak of an Ascanius,
a leader of the Phrygians, who came from Ascania, and
of an Ascanius, a leader of the Mysians, coming also from
Ascania, for there is much repetition of names derived from
rivers, lakes, and places.</p>

<p>6. The poet himself assigns the &AElig;sepus as the boundary of
the Mysians, for after having described the country above
Ilium, and lying along the foot of the mountains subject to
&AElig;neas, and which he calls Dardania, he places next towards
the north Lycia, which was subject to Pandarus, and where
Zeleia<a name="FNanchor_1219" id="FNanchor_1219"></a><a href="#Footnote_1219" class="fnanchor">1219</a> was situated; he says,</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;They who inhabited Zeleia, at the very foot of Ida, Aphneii Trojans,
who drink of the dark stream of &AElig;sepus;&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1220" id="FNanchor_1220"></a><a href="#Footnote_1220" class="fnanchor">1220</a></p>

<p>below Zeleia, towards the sea, on this side of &AElig;sepus, lies the
plain of Adrasteia, and Tereia, Pitya, and in general the present
district of Cyzicene near Priapus,<a name="FNanchor_1221" id="FNanchor_1221"></a><a href="#Footnote_1221" class="fnanchor">1221</a> which he afterwards
describes. He then returns again to the parts towards the east,
and to those lying above, by which he shows that he considered
the country as far as the &AElig;sepus the northern and
eastern boundary of the Troad. Next to the Troad are Mysia
and Olympus.<a name="FNanchor_1222" id="FNanchor_1222"></a><a href="#Footnote_1222" class="fnanchor">1222</a> Ancient tradition then suggests some
such disposition of these nations. But the present changes
have produced many differences in consequence of the continual
succession of governors of the country, who confounded
together people and districts, and separated others. The
Phrygians and Mysians were masters of the country after the
capture of Troy; afterwards the Lydians; then the &AElig;olians
and Ionians; next, the Persians and Macedonians; lastly, the
Romans, under whose government most of the tribes have lost
even their languages and names, in consequence of a new
partition of the country having been made. It will be proper
to take this into consideration when we describe its present
state, at the same time showing a due regard to antiquity.</p>

<p>7. In the inland parts of Bithynia is Bithynium,<a name="FNanchor_1223" id="FNanchor_1223"></a><a href="#Footnote_1223" class="fnanchor">1223</a> situated
above Tieium,<a name="FNanchor_1224" id="FNanchor_1224"></a><a href="#Footnote_1224" class="fnanchor">1224</a> and to which belongs the country about Salon,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]<br />[CAS. 565]</a></span>
affording the best pasturage for cattle, whence comes the cheese
of Salon. Nic&aelig;a,<a name="FNanchor_1225" id="FNanchor_1225"></a><a href="#Footnote_1225" class="fnanchor">1225</a> the capital of Bithynia, is situated on the
Ascanian lake. It is surrounded by a very large and very
fertile plain, which in the summer is not very healthy. Its
first founder was Antigonus, the son of Philip, who called it
Antigonia. It was then rebuilt by Lysimachus, who changed
its name to that of his wife Nic&aelig;a. She was the daughter of
Antipater. The city is situated in a plain. Its shape is
quadrangular, eleven stadia in circuit. It has four gates. Its
streets are divided at right angles, so that the four gates may
be seen from a single stone, set up in the middle of the Gymnasium.
A little above the Ascanian lake is Otr&#339;a, a small
town situated just on the borders of Bithynia towards the east.
It is conjectured that Otr&#339;a was so called from Otreus.</p>

<p>8. That Bithynia was a colony of the Mysians, first Scylax
of Caryanda will testify, who says that Phrygians and Mysians
dwell around the Ascanian lake. The next witness is
Dionysius, who composed a work on &#8220;the foundation of cities.&#8221;
He says that the straits at Chalcedon, and Byzantium, which
are now called the Thracian, were formerly called the Mysian
Bosporus. Some person might allege this as a proof that the
Mysians were Thracians; and Euphorio says,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;by the waters of the Mysian Ascanius;&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>and thus also Alexander the &AElig;tolian,</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;who have their dwellings near the Ascanian waters, on the margin of the
Ascanian lake, where Dolion dwelt, the son of Silenus and of Melia.&#8221;</p>

<p>These authors testify the same thing, because the Ascanian
lake is found in no other situation but this.</p>

<p>9. Men distinguished for their learning, natives of Bithynia,
were Xenocrates the philosopher, Dionysius the dialectician,
Hipparchus, Theodosius and his sons the mathematicians,
Cleophanes the rhetorician of Myrleia, and Asclepiades the
physician of Prusa.<a name="FNanchor_1226" id="FNanchor_1226"></a><a href="#Footnote_1226" class="fnanchor">1226</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span></p>

<p>10. To the south of the Bithynians are the Mysians about
Olympus (whom some writers call Bithyni Olympeni, and
others Hellespontii) and Phrygia upon the Hellespont. To the
south of the Paphlagonians are the Galatians, and still further
to the south of both these nations are the Greater Phrygia,
and Lycaonia, extending as far as the Cilician and Pisidian
Taurus. But since the parts continuous with Paphlagonia adjoin
Pontus, Cappadocia, and the nations which we have just
described, it may be proper first to give an account of the
parts in the neighbourhood of these nations, and then proceed
to a description of the places next in order.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">To</span> the south of the Paphlagonians are the Galatians, of
whom there are three tribes; two of them, the Trocmi and
the Tolistobogii, have their names from their chiefs; the third,
the Tectosages, from the tribe of that name in Celtica. The
Galatians took possession of this country after wandering about
for a long period, and overrunning the country subject to the
Attalic and the Bithynian kings, until they received by a
voluntary cession the present Galatia, or Gallo-Gr&aelig;cia, as it is
called. Leonnorius seems to have been the chief leader of these
people when they passed over into Asia. There were three
nations that spoke the same language, and in no respect differed
from one another. Each of them was divided into four
portions called tetrarchies, and had its own tetrarch, its own
judge, and one superintendent of the army, all of whom were
under the control of the tetrarch, and two subordinate superintendents
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]<br />[CAS. 567]</a></span>
of the army. The Council of the twelve Tetrarchs
consisted of three hundred persons, who assembled at a place
called the Drynemetum.<a name="FNanchor_1227" id="FNanchor_1227"></a><a href="#Footnote_1227" class="fnanchor">1227</a> The council determined causes relative
to murder, the others were decided by the tetrarchs and
the judges. Such, anciently, was the political constitution of
Galatia; but, in our time, the government was in the hands of
three chiefs, then of two, and at last it was administered by
De&iuml;otarus, who was succeeded by Amyntas. At present, the
Romans possess this as well as all the country which was subject
to Amyntas, and have reduced it into one province.</p>

<p>2. The Trocmi occupy the parts near Pontus and Cappadocia,
which are the best which the Galatians possess. They
have three walled fortresses, Tavium, a mart for the people in
that quarter, where there is a colossal statue of Jupiter in brass,
and a grove, which is used as a place of refuge; Mithridatium,
which Pompey gave to Bogodiatarus, (De&iuml;otarus?) having
separated it from the kingdom of Pontus; and thirdly, Danala,
where Pompey, when he was about to leave the country to
celebrate his triumph, met Lucullus and delivered over to him
as his successor the command of the war.</p>

<p>This is the country which the Trocmi possess.</p>

<p>The Tectosages occupy the parts towards the greater
Phrygia near Pessinus,<a name="FNanchor_1228" id="FNanchor_1228"></a><a href="#Footnote_1228" class="fnanchor">1228</a> and the Orcaorci. They had the
fortress Ancyra,<a name="FNanchor_1229" id="FNanchor_1229"></a><a href="#Footnote_1229" class="fnanchor">1229</a> of the same name as the small Phrygian
city towards Lydia near Blaudus.<a name="FNanchor_1230" id="FNanchor_1230"></a><a href="#Footnote_1230" class="fnanchor">1230</a> The Tolistobogii border
upon the Bithynians, and Phrygia Epictetus, as it is called.
They possess the fortresses Blucium, (Luceium,) which was the
royal seat of De&iuml;otarus, and Pe&iuml;um, which was his treasure-hold.</p>

<p>3. Pessinus is the largest mart of any in that quarter. It
contains a temple of the Mother of the Gods, held in the
highest veneration. The goddess is called Agdistis. The
priests anciently were a sort of sovereigns, and derived a large
revenue from their office. At present their consequence is
much diminished, but the mart still subsists. The sacred
enclosure was adorned with fitting magnificence by the Attalic
kings,<a name="FNanchor_1231" id="FNanchor_1231"></a><a href="#Footnote_1231" class="fnanchor">1231</a> with a temple, and porticos of marble. The Romans
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
gave importance to the temple by sending for the statue of the
goddess from thence according to the oracle of the Sibyl, as
they had sent for that of Asclepius from Epidaurus.</p>

<p>The mountain Dindymus is situated above the city; from
Dindymus comes Dindymene, as from Cybela, Cybele. Near
it runs the river Sangarius, and on its banks are the ancient
dwellings of the Phrygians, of Midas, and of Gordius before
his time, and of some others, which do not preserve the
vestiges of cities, but are villages a little larger than the rest.
Such is Gordium,<a name="FNanchor_1232" id="FNanchor_1232"></a><a href="#Footnote_1232" class="fnanchor">1232</a> and Gorbeus (Gordeus), the royal seat
of Castor, son of Saocondarius, (Saocondarus?) in which he
was put to death by his father-in-law, De&iuml;otarus, who there
also murdered his own daughter. De&iuml;otarus razed the fortress,
and destroyed the greater part of the settlement.</p>

<p>4. Next to Galatia towards the south is the lake Tatta,<a name="FNanchor_1233" id="FNanchor_1233"></a><a href="#Footnote_1233" class="fnanchor">1233</a>
lying parallel to that part of the Greater Cappadocia which
is near the Morimeni. It belongs to the Greater Phrygia, as
well as the country continuous with this, and extending as
far as the Taurus, and of which Amyntas possessed the greatest
part. Tatta is a natural salt-pan. The water so readily
makes a deposit around everything immersed in it, that upon
letting down wreaths formed of rope, chaplets of salt are drawn
up. If birds touch the surface of the water with their wings,
they immediately fall down in consequence of the concretion
of the salt upon them, and are thus taken.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Such</span> is the description of Tatta. The places around
Orcaorci, Pitnisus and the mountainous plains of Lycaonia,
are cold and bare, affording pasture only for wild asses; there
is a great scarcity of water, but wherever it is found the wells
are very deep, as at Soatra, where it is even sold. Soatra is
a village city near Garsabora (Garsaura?). Although the
country is ill supplied with water, it is surprisingly well
adapted for feeding sheep, but the wool is coarse. Some
persons have acquired very great wealth by these flocks alone.
Amyntas had above three hundred flocks of sheep in these
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]<br />[CAS. 568]</a></span>
parts. In this district there are two lakes, the greater Coralis,
the smaller Trogitis. Somewhere here is Iconium,<a name="FNanchor_1234" id="FNanchor_1234"></a><a href="#Footnote_1234" class="fnanchor">1234</a> a small
town, well built, about which is a more fertile tract of land
than the pastures for the wild asses before mentioned. Polemo
possessed this place.</p>

<p>Here the Taurus approaches this country, separating Cappadocia
and Lycaonia from Cilicia Tracheia. It is the boundary
of the Lycaonians and Cappadocians, between Coropassus,
a village of the Lycaonians, and Gareathyra (Garsaura), a
small town of the Cappadocians. The distance between these
fortressess is about 120 stadia.</p>

<p>2. To Lycaonia belongs Isaurica, near the Taurus, in which
are the Isaura, two villages of the same name, one of which is
surnamed Pal&aelig;a, or the Old, the other [the New], the latter is
well fortified.<a name="FNanchor_1235" id="FNanchor_1235"></a><a href="#Footnote_1235" class="fnanchor">1235</a> There were many other villages dependent
upon these. They are all of them, however, the dwellings of
robbers. They occasioned much trouble to the Romans, and
to Publius Servilius, surnamed Isauricus, with whom I was
acquainted; he subjected these places to the Romans, and
destroyed also many of the strong-holds of the pirates, situated
upon the sea.</p>

<p>3. Derbe,<a name="FNanchor_1236" id="FNanchor_1236"></a><a href="#Footnote_1236" class="fnanchor">1236</a> the royal seat of the tyrant Antipater, surnamed
Derb&aelig;tes, is on the side of the Isaurian territory close upon
Cappadocia. Laranda<a name="FNanchor_1237" id="FNanchor_1237"></a><a href="#Footnote_1237" class="fnanchor">1237</a> also belonged to Antipater. In my
time Amyntas attacked and killed Antipater Derb&aelig;tes, and
got possession of the Isaura and of Derbe. The Romans
gave him the Isaura where he built a palace for himself, after
having destroyed Isauria Pal&aelig;a (the Old). He began to build
in the same place a new wall, but before its completion he was
killed by the Cilicians in an ambuscade, when invading the
country of the Homonadeis.</p>

<p>4. For being in possession of Antiocheia near Pisidia, and
the country as far as Apollonias,<a name="FNanchor_1238" id="FNanchor_1238"></a><a href="#Footnote_1238" class="fnanchor">1238</a> near Apameia Cibotus,<a name="FNanchor_1239" id="FNanchor_1239"></a><a href="#Footnote_1239" class="fnanchor">1239</a> some
parts of the Paroreia, and Lycaonia, he attempted to exterminate
the Cilicians and Pisidians, who descended from the
Taurus and overran this district, which belonged to the
Phrygians and Cilicians (Lycaonians). He razed also many
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
fortresses, which before this time were considered impregnable,
among which was Cremna, but he did not attempt to take
by storm Sandalium, situated between Cremna and Sagalassus.</p>

<p>5. Cremna is occupied by a Roman colony.</p>

<p>Sagalassus is under the command of the same Roman governor,
to whom all the kingdom of Amyntas is subject. It
is distant from Apameia a day&#8217;s journey, having a descent of
nearly 30 stadia from the fortress. It has the name also of
Selgessus. It was taken by Alexander.</p>

<p>Amyntas made himself master of Cremna and passed into
the country of the Homonadeis, who were supposed to be the
most difficult to reduce of all the tribes. He had already got
into his power most of their strong-holds, and had killed the
tyrant himself, when he was taken prisoner by an artifice of
the wife of the tyrant, whom he had killed, and was put to
death by the people. Cyrinius (Quirinus)<a name="FNanchor_1240" id="FNanchor_1240"></a><a href="#Footnote_1240" class="fnanchor">1240</a> reduced them by
famine and took four thousand men prisoners, whom he settled
as inhabitants in the neighbouring cities, but he left no person
in the country in the prime of life.</p>

<p>Among the heights of Taurus, and in the midst of rocks
and precipices for the most part inaccessible, is a hollow and
fertile plain divided into several valleys. The inhabitants
cultivate this plain, but live among the overhanging heights
of the mountains, or in caves. They are for the most part
armed, and accustomed to make incursions into the country of
other tribes, their own being protected by mountains, which
serve as a wall.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER VII.</h3>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Contiguous</span> to these, among other tribes of the Pisidians,
are the Selgeis, the most considerable tribe of the nation.</p>

<p>The greater part of the Pisidians occupy the summits of
Taurus, but some tribes situated above Side<a name="FNanchor_1241" id="FNanchor_1241"></a><a href="#Footnote_1241" class="fnanchor">1241</a> and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]<br />[CAS. 570]</a></span>
Aspendus,<a name="FNanchor_1242" id="FNanchor_1242"></a><a href="#Footnote_1242" class="fnanchor">1242</a>
which are Pamphylian cities, occupy heights, all of which
are planted with olives. The parts above these, a mountainous
country, are occupied by the Catennenses, who border upon
the Selgeis and the Homonadeis. The Sagalasseis occupy
the parts within the Taurus towards Milyas.</p>

<p>2. Artemidorus says that Selge, Sagalassus, Petnelissus,
Adada, Tymbrias, Cremna, Pityassus, (Tityassus?) Amblada,
Anabura, Sinda, Aarassus, Tarbassus, Termessus, are cities of
the Pisidians. Of these some are entirely among the mountains,
others extend on each side even as far as the country at
the foot of the mountains, and reach to Pamphylia and Milyas,
and border on Phrygians, Lydians, and Carians, all of whom
are disposed to peace, although situated to the north.<a name="FNanchor_1243" id="FNanchor_1243"></a><a href="#Footnote_1243" class="fnanchor">1243</a></p>

<p>The Pamphylians, who partake much of the character of
the Cilician nation, do not altogether abstain from predatory
enterprises, nor permit the people on the confines to live in
peace, although they occupy the southern parts of the country
at the foot of Taurus.</p>

<p>On the confines of Phrygia and Caria, are Tab&aelig;,<a name="FNanchor_1244" id="FNanchor_1244"></a><a href="#Footnote_1244" class="fnanchor">1244</a> Sinda,
and Amblada, whence is procured the Amblada wine, which
is used in diet prescribed for the sick.</p>

<p>3. All the rest of the mountain tribes of the Pisidians
whom I have spoken of are divided into states governed by
tyrants, and follow like the Cilicians a predatory mode of
life. It is said that anciently some of the Leleges, a wandering
people, were intermixed with them, and from the similarity
of their habits and manners settled there.</p>

<p>Selge<a name="FNanchor_1245" id="FNanchor_1245"></a><a href="#Footnote_1245" class="fnanchor">1245</a> had the rank of a city from the first when founded by
the Laced&aelig;monians, but at a still earlier period by Calchas.
Latterly it has maintained its condition and flourished in consequence
of its excellent constitution and government, so that
at one time it had a population of 20,000 persons. The place
deserves admiration from the advantages which nature has
bestowed upon it. Among the summits of Taurus is a very
fertile tract capable of maintaining many thousand inhabitants.
Many spots produce the olive and excellent vines, and
afford abundant pasture for animals of all kinds. Above and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
all around are forests containing trees of various sorts. The
styrax is found here in great abundance, a tree not large but
straight in its growth. Javelins, similar to those of the
cornel tree, are made of the wood of this tree. There is bred
in the trunk of the styrax tree, a worm, which eats through
the timber to the surface, and throws out raspings like bran, or
saw-dust, a heap of which is collected at the root. Afterwards
a liquid distils which readily concretes into a mass
like gum. A part of this liquid descends upon and mixes
with the raspings at the root of the tree, and with earth; a
portion of it acquires consistence on the surface of the mass,
and remains pure. That portion which flows along the surface
of the trunk of the tree, and concretes, is also pure. A
mixture is made of the impure part, which is a combination of
wood-dust and earth; this has more odour than the pure styrax,
but is inferior to it in its other properties. This is not commonly
known. It is used for incense in large quantities by
superstitious worshippers of the gods.</p>

<p>The Selgic iris<a name="FNanchor_1246" id="FNanchor_1246"></a><a href="#Footnote_1246" class="fnanchor">1246</a> also, and the unguent which is made from
it, are in great esteem. There are few approaches about the
city, and the mountainous country of the Selgeis, which
abounds with precipices and ravines, formed among other
rivers by the Eurymedon<a name="FNanchor_1247" id="FNanchor_1247"></a><a href="#Footnote_1247" class="fnanchor">1247</a> and the Cestrus,<a name="FNanchor_1248" id="FNanchor_1248"></a><a href="#Footnote_1248" class="fnanchor">1248</a> which descend
from the Selgic mountains, and discharge themselves
into the Pamphylian Sea. There are bridges on the roads.
From the strength and security of their position the Selgeis
were never at any time, nor on any single occasion, subject
to any other people, but enjoyed unmolested the produce
of their country, with the exception of that part situated below
them in Pamphylia, and that within the Taurus, for which
they were carrying on a continual warfare with the kings.</p>

<p>Their position with respect to the Romans was that they
possessed this tract on certain conditions. They sent ambassadors
to Alexander and offered to receive his commands in the
character of friends, but at present they are altogether subject
to the Romans, and are included in what was formerly the
kingdom of Amyntas.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">The</span> people called Mysians, and Phrygians, who live
around the so-called Mysian Olympus, border upon the Bithynians
to the south. Each of these nations is divided into
two parts. One is called the Greater Phrygia, of which
Midas was king. A part of it was occupied by the Galatians.
The other is the Lesser, or Phrygia on the Hellespont, or
Phrygia around Olympus, and is also called Epictetus.</p>

<p>Mysia is also divided into two parts; Olympic Mysia,
which is continuous with Bithynia, and with the Epictetus,
(which, Artemidorus says, was inhabited by the Mysians beyond
the Danube,) and the part around the Ca&iuml;cus,<a name="FNanchor_1249" id="FNanchor_1249"></a><a href="#Footnote_1249" class="fnanchor">1249</a> and the
Pergamene<a name="FNanchor_1250" id="FNanchor_1250"></a><a href="#Footnote_1250" class="fnanchor">1250</a> as far as Teuthrania, and the mouths of the river.</p>

<p>2. This country, however, as we have frequently observed,
has undergone so many changes, that it is uncertain whether
the district around Sipylus,<a name="FNanchor_1251" id="FNanchor_1251"></a><a href="#Footnote_1251" class="fnanchor">1251</a> which the ancients called Phrygia,
were a part of the Greater or the Lesser Phrygia, from whence
Tantalus, Pelops, and Niobe were called Phrygians. Whatever
the explanation may be, the change is certain. For Pergamene
and Ela&iuml;tis,<a name="FNanchor_1252" id="FNanchor_1252"></a><a href="#Footnote_1252" class="fnanchor">1252</a> through which country the Ca&iuml;cus passes,
and empties itself into the sea, and Teuthrania, situated between
these two districts, where Teuthras lived, and Telephus
was brought up, lies between the Hellespont, and the
country about Sipylus, and Magnesia, which is at the foot of
the mountain, so that, as I have said, it is difficult</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;To assign the confines of the Mysians and Phryges.&#8221;&mdash;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>3. The Lydians also, and the M&aelig;ones, whom Homer calls
Meones, are in some way confounded with these people
and with one another; some authors say that they are the
same, others that they are different, nations. Add to this that
some writers regard the Mysians as Thracians, others as Lydians,
according to an ancient tradition, which has been preserved
by Xanthus the Lydian, and by Menecrates of El&aelig;a,
who assign as the origin of the name Mysians, that the
Lydians call the beech-tree (Oxya) Mysos, which grows in
great abundance near Olympus, where it is said decimated
persons<a name="FNanchor_1253" id="FNanchor_1253"></a><a href="#Footnote_1253" class="fnanchor">1253</a> were exposed, whose descendants are the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
later Mysians, and received their appellation from the Mysos,
or beech-tree growing in that country. The language also is
an evidence of this. It is a mixture of Lydian and Phrygian
words, for they lived some time in the neighbourhood of
Olympus. But when the Phrygians passed over from Thrace,
and put to death the chief of Troy and of the country near
it, they settled here, but the Mysians established themselves
above the sources of the Ca&iuml;cus near Lydia.</p>

<p>4. The confusion which has existed among the nations in
this district, and even the fertility of the country within the
Halys, particularly near the sea, have contributed to the invention
of fables of this sort. The richness of the country
provoked attacks, from various quarters, and at all times, of
tribes who came from the opposite coast, or neighbouring
people contended with one another for the possession of it.
Inroads and migrations took place chiefly about the period
of the Trojan war, and subsequently to that time, Barbarians
as well as Greeks showing an eagerness to get possession of
the territory of other nations. This disposition, however,
showed itself before the time of the Trojan war; for there
existed then tribes of Pelasgi, Caucones, and Leleges, who are
said to have wandered, anciently, over various parts of Europe.
The poet represents them as assisting the Trojans, but not as
coming from the opposite coast. The accounts respecting the
Phrygians and the Mysians are more ancient than the Trojan
times.</p>

<p>Two tribes bearing the name of Lycians, lead us to suppose
that they are the same race; either the Trojan Lycians sent
colonies to the Carians, or the Carian Lycians to the Trojans.
Perhaps the same may be the case with the Cilicians, for they
also are divided into two tribes; but we have not the same
evidence that the present Cilicians existed before the Trojan
times. Telephus may be supposed to have come with his
mother from Arcadia; by her marriage with Teuthras, (who
had received them as his guests,) Telephus was admitted into the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]<br />[CAS. 572]</a></span>
family of Teuthras, was reputed to be his son, and succeeded
to the kingdom of the Mysians.</p>

<p>5. &#8220;The Carians, who were formerly islanders, and Leleges,&#8221;
it is said, &#8220;settled on the continent with the assistance
of the Cretans. They built Miletus, of which the founder was
Sarpedon from Miletus in Crete. They settled the colony
of Termil&aelig; in the present Lycia, but, according to Herodotus,<a name="FNanchor_1254" id="FNanchor_1254"></a><a href="#Footnote_1254" class="fnanchor">1254</a>
these people were a colony from Crete under the conduct of
Sarpedon, brother of Minos and Rhadamanthus, who gave the
name of Termil&aelig; to the people formerly called Mily&aelig;, and
still more anciently Solymi; when, however, Lycus the son of
Pandion arrived, he called them Lycii after his own name.&#8221;
This account shows that the Solymi and Lycians were the
same people, but the poet distinguishes them. He represents
Bellerophon setting out from Lycia, and</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;fighting with the renowned Solymi.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1255" id="FNanchor_1255"></a><a href="#Footnote_1255" class="fnanchor">1255</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>He says Peisander (Isander?), his son, Mars</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;slew when fighting with the Solymi,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1256" id="FNanchor_1256"></a><a href="#Footnote_1256" class="fnanchor">1256</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>and speaks of Sarpedon as a native of Lycia.<a name="FNanchor_1257" id="FNanchor_1257"></a><a href="#Footnote_1257" class="fnanchor">1257</a></p>

<p>6. That the common prize, proposed to be obtained by the
conquerors, was the fertile country which I am describing, is
confirmed by many circumstances which happened both before
and after the Trojan times. When even the Amazons
ventured to invade it, Priam and Bellerophon are said to have
undertaken an expedition against these women. Anciently
there were cities which bore the names of the Amazons. In
the Ilian plain there is a hill</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;which men call Batieia, but the immortals, the tomb of the bounding
(&#960;&#959;&#955;&#965;&#963;&#954;&#8049;&#961;&#952;&#956;&#959;&#953;&#959;) Myrina,&#8221;</p>

<p>who, according to historians, was one of the Amazons, and
they found this conjecture on the epithet, for horses are said
to be &#949;&#8016;&#963;&#954;&#8049;&#961;&#952;&#956;&#959;&#953; on account of their speed; and she was called
&#960;&#959;&#955;&#8059;&#963;&#954;&#945;&#961;&#952;&#956;&#959;&#962; from the rapidity with which she drove the
chariot. Myrina therefore, the place, was named after the
Amazon. In the same manner the neighbouring islands
were invaded on account of their fertility; among which were
Rhodes and Cos. That they were inhabited before the Trojan
times clearly appears from the testimony of Homer.<a name="FNanchor_1258" id="FNanchor_1258"></a><a href="#Footnote_1258" class="fnanchor">1258</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span></p>

<p>7. After the Trojan times, the migrations of Greeks and
of Treres, the inroads of Cimmerians and Lydians, afterwards
of Persians and Macedonians, and lastly of Galatians,
threw everything into confusion. An obscurity arose
not from these changes only, but from the disagreement between
authors in their narration of the same events, and in
their description of the same persons; for they called Trojans
Phrygians, like the Tragic poets; and Lycians Carians, and
similarly in other instances. The Trojans who, from a small
beginning, increased so much in power that they became kings
of kings, furnished a motive to the poet and his interpreters,
for determining what country ought to be called Troy.
For the poet calls by the common name of Trojans all their
auxiliaries, as he calls their enemies Danai and Ach&aelig;i. But
certainly we should not give the name of Troy to Paphlagonia,
or to Caria, or to Lycia, which borders upon it. I
mean when the poet says,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;the Trojans advanced with the clashing of armour and shouts,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1259" id="FNanchor_1259"></a><a href="#Footnote_1259" class="fnanchor">1259</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>and where he speaks of their enemies,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;but the Ach&aelig;i advanced silently, breathing forth warlike ardour,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1260" id="FNanchor_1260"></a><a href="#Footnote_1260" class="fnanchor">1260</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>and thus frequently in other passages.</p>

<p>We must endeavour, however, to distinguish as far as we are
able one nation from another, notwithstanding this uncertainty.
If anything relative to ancient history escapes my
notice, it must be pardoned, for this is not the province of
the geographer; my concern is with the present state of
people and places.</p>

<p>8. There are two mountains situated above the Propontis,
the Mysian Olympus<a name="FNanchor_1261" id="FNanchor_1261"></a><a href="#Footnote_1261" class="fnanchor">1261</a> and Ida.<a name="FNanchor_1262" id="FNanchor_1262"></a><a href="#Footnote_1262" class="fnanchor">1262</a> At the foot of Olympus is
Bithynia, and, contiguous to the mountain, between Ida and
the sea, is Troy.</p>

<p>We shall afterwards speak of Troy, and of the places continuous
with it on the south. At present we shall give an
account of the places about Olympus, and of the adjoining
country as far as the Taurus, and parallel to the parts which
we have previously described.</p>

<p>The country lying around Olympus is not well inhabited.
On its heights are immense forests and strongholds, well adapted

for the protection of robbers, who, being able to maintain
themselves there for any length of time, often set themselves
up as tyrants, as Cleon a captain of a band of robbers did in
my recollection.</p>

<p>9. Cleon was a native of the village Gordium, which he
afterwards enlarged, and erected into a city, giving it the
name of Juliopolis. His first retreat and head-quarters was
a place called Callydium, one of the strongest holds. He was
of service to Antony in attacking the soldiers who collected
money for Labienus, at the time that the latter occupied Asia,
and thus hindered the preparations which he was making for
his defence. In the Actian war he separated himself from
Antony and attached himself to the generals of C&aelig;sar; he
was rewarded above his deserts, for in addition to what he received
from Antony he obtained power from C&aelig;sar, and exchanged
the character of a freebooter for that of a petty
prince. He was priest of Jupiter Abrettenus, the Mysian
god, and a portion of the Morena was subject to him, which,
like Abrettena, is Mysian. He finally obtained the priesthood
of Comana in Pontus, and went to take possession of it,
but died within a month after his arrival. He was carried
off by an acute disease, occasioned either by excessive repletion,
or, according to the account of those employed about the
temple, inflicted by the anger of the goddess. The story is
this. Within the circuit of the sacred enclosure is the dwelling
of the priest and priestess. Besides other sacred observances
relative to the temple, the purity of this enclosure is an
especial object of vigilance, by abstinence from eating swine&#8217;s
flesh. The whole city, indeed, is bound to abstain from this
food, and swine are not permitted to enter it. Cleon, however,
immediately upon his arrival displayed his lawless disposition
and character by violating this custom, as if he had come
there not as a priest, but a polluter of sacred things.</p>

<p>10. The description of Olympus is as follows. Around
it, to the north, live Bithynians, Mygdonians, and Doliones;
the rest is occupied by Mysians and Epicteti. The
tribes about Cyzicus<a name="FNanchor_1263" id="FNanchor_1263"></a><a href="#Footnote_1263" class="fnanchor">1263</a> from &AElig;sepus<a name="FNanchor_1264" id="FNanchor_1264"></a><a href="#Footnote_1264" class="fnanchor">1264</a> as far as Rhyndacus<a name="FNanchor_1265" id="FNanchor_1265"></a><a href="#Footnote_1265" class="fnanchor">1265</a> and
the lake Dascylitis,<a name="FNanchor_1266" id="FNanchor_1266"></a><a href="#Footnote_1266" class="fnanchor">1266</a> are called for the most part Doliones;
those next to the Doliones, and extending as far as the territory
of the Myrleani,<a name="FNanchor_1267" id="FNanchor_1267"></a><a href="#Footnote_1267" class="fnanchor">1267</a> are called Mygdones. Above the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
Dascylitis are two large lakes, the Apolloniatis,<a name="FNanchor_1268" id="FNanchor_1268"></a><a href="#Footnote_1268" class="fnanchor">1268</a> and the Miletopolitis.<a name="FNanchor_1269" id="FNanchor_1269"></a><a href="#Footnote_1269" class="fnanchor">1269</a>
Near the Dascylitis is the city Dascylium, and on
the Miletopolitis, Miletopolis. Near a third lake is Apollonia
on the Rhyndacus, as it is called. Most of these places belong
at present to the Cyziceni.</p>

<p>11. Cyzicus is an island<a name="FNanchor_1270" id="FNanchor_1270"></a><a href="#Footnote_1270" class="fnanchor">1270</a> in the Propontis, joined to the continent
by two bridges. It is exceedingly fertile. It is about
500 stadia in circumference. There is a city of the same
name near the bridges, with two close harbours, and more
than two hundred docks for vessels. One part of the city is
in a plain, the other near the mountain which is called
Arcton-oros (or Bear-mountain). Above this is another
mountain, the Dindymus, with one peak, having on it a temple
founded by the Argonauts in honour of Dindymene, mother of
the gods. This city rivals in size, beauty, and in the excellent
administration of affairs, both in peace and war, the
cities which hold the first rank in Asia. It appears to be
embellished in a manner similar to Rhodes, Massalia,<a name="FNanchor_1271" id="FNanchor_1271"></a><a href="#Footnote_1271" class="fnanchor">1271</a> and
ancient Carthage. I omit many details. There are three
architects, to whom is intrusted the care of the public edifices
and engines. The city has also three store-houses, one for
arms, one for engines, and one for corn. The Chalcidic earth
mixed with the corn prevents it from spoiling. The utility
of preserving it in this manner was proved in the Mithridatic
war. The king attacked the city unexpectedly with an army of
150,000 men and a large body of cavalry, and made himself
master of the opposite hill, which is called the hill of Adrasteia,
and of the suburb. He afterwards transferred his camp
to the neck of land above the city, blockaded it by land, and
attacked it by sea with four hundred ships. The Cyziceni
resisted all these attempts, and were even nearly capturing
the king in a subterraneous passage, by working a countermine.
He was, however, apprized of it, and escaped by retreating
in time out of the excavation. Lucullus, the Roman
general, was able, though late, to send succours into the city
by night. Famine also came to the aid of the Cyziceni by
spreading among this large army. The king did not foresee
this, and after losing great numbers of his men went away.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]<br />[CAS. 576]</a></span>
The Romans respected the city, and to this present time it enjoys
freedom. A large territory belongs to it, some part of
which it has held from the earliest times; the rest was a gift
of the Romans. Of the Troad they possess the parts beyond
the &AElig;sepus, namely, those about Zeleia and the plain of Adrasteia;
a part of the lake Dascylitis belongs to them, the other part
belongs to the Byzantines. They also possess a large district near
the Dolionis, and the Mygdonis, extending as far as the lake
Miletopolitis, and the Apolloniatis. Through these countries
runs the river Rhyndacus, which has its source in the Azanitis.
Having received from Mysia Abrettene, among other rivers,
the Macestus,<a name="FNanchor_1272" id="FNanchor_1272"></a><a href="#Footnote_1272" class="fnanchor">1272</a> which comes from Ancyra<a name="FNanchor_1273" id="FNanchor_1273"></a><a href="#Footnote_1273" class="fnanchor">1273</a> in the Abaeitis
it empties itself into the Propontis at the island Besbicus.<a name="FNanchor_1274" id="FNanchor_1274"></a><a href="#Footnote_1274" class="fnanchor">1274</a></p>

<p>In this island of the Cyziceni is the mountain Artace, well
wooded, and in front of it lies a small island of the same name,
near it is the promontory Melas (or Black), as it is called,
which is met with in coasting from Cyzicus to Priapus.<a name="FNanchor_1275" id="FNanchor_1275"></a><a href="#Footnote_1275" class="fnanchor">1275</a></p>

<p>12. To Phrygian Epictetus belong the Azani, and the cities
Nacoleia, Cotiaeium,<a name="FNanchor_1276" id="FNanchor_1276"></a><a href="#Footnote_1276" class="fnanchor">1276</a> Midiaeium, Doryl&aelig;um,<a name="FNanchor_1277" id="FNanchor_1277"></a><a href="#Footnote_1277" class="fnanchor">1277</a> and Cadi.<a name="FNanchor_1278" id="FNanchor_1278"></a><a href="#Footnote_1278" class="fnanchor">1278</a> Some
persons assign Cadi to Mysia.</p>

<p>Mysia extends in the inland parts from Olympene to Pergamene,
and to the plain of Ca&iuml;cus, as it is called; so that it lies
between Ida and the Catacecaumene, which some place in
Mysia, others in M&aelig;onia.</p>

<p>13. Beyond the Epictetus to the south is the Greater Phrygia,
leaving on the left Pessinus, and the parts about Orcaorci,
and Lycaonia, and on the right M&aelig;ones, Lydians, and Carians.
In the Epictetus are Phrygia Paroreia, and the country towards
Pisidia, and the parts about Amorium,<a name="FNanchor_1279" id="FNanchor_1279"></a><a href="#Footnote_1279" class="fnanchor">1279</a> Eumeneia,<a name="FNanchor_1280" id="FNanchor_1280"></a><a href="#Footnote_1280" class="fnanchor">1280</a> and
Synnada.<a name="FNanchor_1281" id="FNanchor_1281"></a><a href="#Footnote_1281" class="fnanchor">1281</a> Next are Apameia Cibotus,<a name="FNanchor_1282" id="FNanchor_1282"></a><a href="#Footnote_1282" class="fnanchor">1282</a> and Laodiceia,<a name="FNanchor_1283" id="FNanchor_1283"></a><a href="#Footnote_1283" class="fnanchor">1283</a> the
largest cities in Phrygia. Around them lie the towns [and
places], Aphrodisias,<a name="FNanchor_1284" id="FNanchor_1284"></a><a href="#Footnote_1284" class="fnanchor">1284</a> Coloss&aelig;,<a name="FNanchor_1285" id="FNanchor_1285"></a><a href="#Footnote_1285" class="fnanchor">1285</a> Themisonium,<a name="FNanchor_1286" id="FNanchor_1286"></a><a href="#Footnote_1286" class="fnanchor">1286</a> Sanaus,
Metropolis,<a name="FNanchor_1287" id="FNanchor_1287"></a><a href="#Footnote_1287" class="fnanchor">1287</a> Apollonias, and farther off than these, Pelt&aelig;,
Tabe&aelig;, Eucarpia, and Lysias.</p>

<p>14. The Paroreia<a name="FNanchor_1288" id="FNanchor_1288"></a><a href="#Footnote_1288" class="fnanchor">1288</a> has a mountainous ridge extending from
east to west. Below it on either side stretches a large plain,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
cities are situated near the ridge, on the north side, Philomelium,<a name="FNanchor_1289" id="FNanchor_1289"></a><a href="#Footnote_1289" class="fnanchor">1289</a>
on the south Antiocheia, surnamed Near Pisidia.<a name="FNanchor_1290" id="FNanchor_1290"></a><a href="#Footnote_1290" class="fnanchor">1290</a>
The former lies entirely in the plain, the other is on a hill,
and occupied by a Roman colony. This was founded by the
Magnetes, who live near the M&aelig;ander. The Romans liberated
them from the dominion of the kings, when they delivered up
the rest of Asia within the Taurus to Eumenes. In this place
was established a priesthood of Men Arc&aelig;us, having attached
to it a multitude of sacred attendants, and tracts of sacred
territory. It was abolished after the death of Amyntas by
those who were sent to settle the succession to his kingdom.</p>

<p>Synnada is not a large city. In front of it is a plain planted
with olives, about 60 stadia in extent. Beyond is Docimia, a
village, and the quarry of the Synnadic marble. This is the
name given to it by the Romans, but the people of the country
call it Docimite and Docim&aelig;an. At first the quarry produced
small masses, but at present, through the extravagance of the
Romans, pillars are obtained, consisting of a single stone and
of great size, approaching the alabastrite marble in variety
of colours; although the distant carriage of such heavy loads
to the sea is difficult, yet both pillars and slabs of surprising
magnitude and beauty are conveyed to Rome.</p>

<p>15. Apameia is a large mart of Asia, properly so called,
and second in rank to Ephesus, for it is the common staple for
merchandise brought from Italy and from Greece. It is
built upon the mouth of the river Marsyas, which runs through
the middle of it, and has its commencement above the city;
being carried down to the suburb with a strong and precipitous
current, it enters the M&aelig;ander,<a name="FNanchor_1291" id="FNanchor_1291"></a><a href="#Footnote_1291" class="fnanchor">1291</a> which receives also another
river, the Orgas, and traverses a level tract with a gentle
and unruffled stream. Here the M&aelig;ander becomes a large
river, and flows for some time through Phrygia; it then
separates Caria and Lydia at the plain, as it is called, of the
M&aelig;ander, running in a direction excessively tortuous, so that
from the course of this river all windings are called M&aelig;anders.
Towards its termination it runs through the part of Caria
occupied by the Ionians; the mouths by which it empties itself
are between Miletus and Priene.<a name="FNanchor_1292" id="FNanchor_1292"></a><a href="#Footnote_1292" class="fnanchor">1292</a> It rises in a hill called
Cel&aelig;n&aelig;, on which was a city of the same name. Antiochus
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]<br />[CAS. 578]</a></span>
Soter transferred the inhabitants to the present Apameia, and
called the city after his mother Apama, who was the daughter
of Artabazus. She was given in marriage to Seleucus Nicator.
Here is laid the scene of the fable of Olympus and
Marsyas, and of the contest between Marsyas and Apollo.
Above is situated a lake<a name="FNanchor_1293" id="FNanchor_1293"></a><a href="#Footnote_1293" class="fnanchor">1293</a> on which grows a reed, which is
suited to the mouth-pieces of pipes. From this lake, it is said,
spring the Marsyas and the M&aelig;ander.</p>

<p>16. Laodiceia,<a name="FNanchor_1294" id="FNanchor_1294"></a><a href="#Footnote_1294" class="fnanchor">1294</a> formerly a small town, has increased in our
time, and in that of our ancestors, although it received great
injury when it was besieged by Mithridates Eupator; the
fertility however of the soil and the prosperity of some of its
citizens have aggrandized it. First, Hiero embellished the city
with many offerings, and bequeathed to the people more than
2000 talents; then Zeno the rhetorician, and his son Polemo,
were an ornament and support to it; the latter was thought
by Antony, and afterwards by Augustus C&aelig;sar, worthy even
of the rank of king in consequence of his valiant and upright
conduct.</p>

<p>The country around Laodiceia breeds excellent sheep, remarkable
not only for the softness of their wool, in which they
surpass the Milesian flocks, but for their dark or raven colour.
The Laodiceans derive a large revenue from them, as
the Colosseni do from their flocks, of a colour of the same
name.</p>

<p>Here the Caprus and the Lycus, a large river, enter the
M&aelig;ander. From the Lycus, a considerable river, Laodiceia has
the name of Laodiceia on the Lycus. Above the city is the
mountain Cadmus, from which the Lycus issues, and another
river of the same name as the mountain. The greater part of
its course is under-ground; it then emerges, and unites with
other rivers, showing that the country abounds with caverns
and is liable to earthquakes. For of all countries Laodiceia
is very subject to earthquakes, as also the neighbouring
district Carura.</p>

<p>17. Carura<a name="FNanchor_1295" id="FNanchor_1295"></a><a href="#Footnote_1295" class="fnanchor">1295</a> is the boundary of Phrygia and Caria. It is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
a village, where there are inns for the reception of travellers,
and springs of boiling water, some of which rise in the river
M&aelig;ander, and others on its banks. There is a story, that a
pimp had lodgings in the inns for a great company of women,
and that during the night he and all the women were overwhelmed
by an earthquake and disappeared. Nearly the
whole of the country about the M&aelig;ander, as far as the inland
parts, is subject to earthquakes, and is undermined by fire and
water. For all this cavernous condition of the country, beginning
from the plains, extends to the Charonia; it exists likewise
in Hierapolis, and in Acharaca in the district Nys&aelig;is, also
in the plain of Magnesia, and in Myus. The soil is dry and
easily reduced to powder, full of salts, and very inflammable.
This perhaps is the reason why the course of the M&aelig;ander is
winding, for the stream is diverted in many places from its
direction, and brings down a great quantity of alluvial soil,
some part of which it deposits in various places along the
shore, and forcing the rest forwards occasions it to drift into
the open sea. It has made, for example, Priene, which was
formerly upon the sea, an inland city, by the deposition of
banks of alluvial earth along an extent of 40 stadia.</p>

<p>18. Phrygia Catacecaumene, (or the Burnt,) which is occupied
by Lydians and Mysians, obtained this name from something
of the following kind. In Philadelphia,<a name="FNanchor_1296" id="FNanchor_1296"></a><a href="#Footnote_1296" class="fnanchor">1296</a> a city adjoining
to it, even the walls of the houses are not safe, for nearly every
day they are shaken, and crevices appear. The inhabitants
are constantly attentive to these accidents to which the ground
is subject, and build with a view to their occurrence.</p>

<p>Apameia among other cities experienced, before the invasion
of Mithridates, frequent earthquakes, and the king, on his
arrival, when he saw the overthrow of the city, gave a hundred
talents for its restoration. It is said that the same thing
happened in the time of Alexander; for this reason it is probable
that Neptune is worshipped there, although they are an
inland people, and that it had the name of Cel&aelig;n&aelig; from Cel&aelig;nus,<a name="FNanchor_1297" id="FNanchor_1297"></a><a href="#Footnote_1297" class="fnanchor">1297</a>
the son of Neptune, by Cel&aelig;no, one of the Dana&iuml;des, or
from the black colour of the stones, or from the blackness
which is the effect of combustion. What is related of Sipylus
and its overthrow is not to be regarded as a fable. For earthquakes
overthrew the present Magnesia, which is situated
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]<br />[CAS. 579]</a></span>
below that mountain, at the time that Sardis and other celebrated
cities in various parts sustained great injury.<a name="FNanchor_1298" id="FNanchor_1298"></a><a href="#Footnote_1298" class="fnanchor">1298</a> The
emperor<a name="FNanchor_1299" id="FNanchor_1299"></a><a href="#Footnote_1299" class="fnanchor">1299</a> gave a sum of money for their restoration, as formerly
his father had assisted the Tralliani on the occurrence of
a similar calamity, when the gymnasium and other parts of
the city were destroyed; in the same manner he had assisted
also the Laodiceans.</p>

<p><a name="xii_viii_19" id="xii_viii_19"></a>19. We must listen, however, to the ancient historians, and
to the account of Xanthus, who composed a history of Lydian
affairs; he relates the changes which had frequently taken place
in this country,&mdash;I have mentioned them in a former part of my
work.<a name="FNanchor_1300" id="FNanchor_1300"></a><a href="#Footnote_1300" class="fnanchor">1300</a> Here is laid the scene of the fable of what befell Typhon;
here are placed the Arimi, and this country is said to be
the Catacecaumene. Nor do historians hesitate to suppose, that
the places between the M&aelig;ander and the Lydians are all of
this nature, as well on account of the number of lakes and
rivers, as the caverns, which are to be found in many parts of
the country. The waters of the lake between Laodiceia and
Apameia, although like a sea, emit a muddy smell, as if they
had come through a subterraneous channel. It is said that
actions are brought against the M&aelig;ander for transferring land
from one place to another by sweeping away the angles of the
windings, and a fine is levied out of the toll, which is paid at
the ferries.</p>

<p>20. Between Laodiceia and Carura is a temple of M&#275;n
Carus, which is held in great veneration. In our time there
was a large Herophilian<a name="FNanchor_1301" id="FNanchor_1301"></a><a href="#Footnote_1301" class="fnanchor">1301</a> school of medicine under the direction
of Zeuxis,<a name="FNanchor_1302" id="FNanchor_1302"></a><a href="#Footnote_1302" class="fnanchor">1302</a> and afterwards of Alexander Philalethes, as
in the time of our ancestors there was, at Smyrna, a school of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
the disciples of Erasistratus under the conduct of Hicesius.
At present there is nothing of this kind.</p>

<p>21. The names of some Phrygian tribes, as the Berecyntes
[and Cerbesii], are mentioned, which no longer exist. And
Alcman says,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;He played the Cerbesian, a Phrygian air.&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>They speak also of a Cerbesian pit which sends forth destructive
exhalations; this however exists, but the people have no
longer the name of Cerbesii. &AElig;schylus in his Niobe<a name="FNanchor_1303" id="FNanchor_1303"></a><a href="#Footnote_1303" class="fnanchor">1303</a> confounds
them; Niobe says that she shall remember Tantalus,
and his story;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;those who have an altar of Jupiter, their paternal god, on the Id&aelig;an
hill,&#8221;</p>

<p>and again;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;Sipylus in the Id&aelig;an land,&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>&mdash;and Tantalus says,</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;I sow the furrows of the Berecynthian fields, extending twelve days&#8217;
journey, where the seat of Adrasteia and Ida resound with the lowing of
herds and the bleating of sheep; all the plain re-echoes with their cries.&#8221;</p>

ASIA.</big><br /><br /></h2>

<p class="center f85">SUMMARY.</p>

<p class="indent">The Thirteenth Book contains the part of Asia south of the Propontis (Sea
of Marmara), the whole of the sea-coast, and the adjacent islands. The
author dwells some time on Troy, though deserted, on account of its distinction,
and the great renown it derived from the war.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">These</span> are the limits of Phrygia. We return again to
the Propontis, and to the sea-coast adjoining the &AElig;sepus,<a name="FNanchor_1304" id="FNanchor_1304"></a><a href="#Footnote_1304" class="fnanchor">1304</a>
and shall observe, in our description of places, the same order
as before.</p>

<p>The first country which presents itself on the sea-coast is
the Troad.<a name="FNanchor_1305" id="FNanchor_1305"></a><a href="#Footnote_1305" class="fnanchor">1305</a> Although it is deserted, and covered with ruins,
yet it is so celebrated as to furnish a writer with no ordinary
excuse for expatiating on its history. But we ought not only
to be excused, but encouraged, for the reader should not impute
the fault of prolixity to us, but to those whose curiosity
and desire of information respecting the celebrated places of
antiquity is to be gratified. The prolixity is greater than it
would be otherwise, from the great number of nations, both
Greeks and Barbarians, who have occupied the country, and
from the disagreement among writers, who do not relate the
same things of the same persons and places, nor even do they
express themselves with clearness. Among these in particular
is Homer, who suggests occasions for conjecture in the greatest
part of his local descriptions. We are therefore to examine
what the poet and other writers advance, premising a
summary description of the nature of the places.</p>

<p><a name="xiii_i_2" id="xiii_i_2"></a>2. The coast of the Propontis extends from Cyzicene and
the places about the &AElig;sepus and Granicus<a name="FNanchor_1306" id="FNanchor_1306"></a><a href="#Footnote_1306" class="fnanchor">1306</a> as far as Abydos,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
and Sestos.<a name="FNanchor_1307" id="FNanchor_1307"></a><a href="#Footnote_1307" class="fnanchor">1307</a> Between Abydos and Lectum<a name="FNanchor_1308" id="FNanchor_1308"></a><a href="#Footnote_1308" class="fnanchor">1308</a> is the country
about Ilium, and Tenedos and Alexandreia Troas.<a name="FNanchor_1309" id="FNanchor_1309"></a><a href="#Footnote_1309" class="fnanchor">1309</a> Above
all these is the mountain Ida, extending as far as Lectum.
From Lectum to the river Ca&iuml;cus<a name="FNanchor_1310" id="FNanchor_1310"></a><a href="#Footnote_1310" class="fnanchor">1310</a> and the Can&aelig; mountains
as they are called is the district comprising Assus,<a name="FNanchor_1311" id="FNanchor_1311"></a><a href="#Footnote_1311" class="fnanchor">1311</a> Adramyttium,<a name="FNanchor_1312" id="FNanchor_1312"></a><a href="#Footnote_1312" class="fnanchor">1312</a>

which places lies the island Lesbos.<a name="FNanchor_1315" id="FNanchor_1315"></a><a href="#Footnote_1315" class="fnanchor">1315</a> Next follows the country
about Cyme<a name="FNanchor_1316" id="FNanchor_1316"></a><a href="#Footnote_1316" class="fnanchor">1316</a> as far as Hermus,<a name="FNanchor_1317" id="FNanchor_1317"></a><a href="#Footnote_1317" class="fnanchor">1317</a> and Phoc&aelig;a,<a name="FNanchor_1318" id="FNanchor_1318"></a><a href="#Footnote_1318" class="fnanchor">1318</a> where
Ionia begins, and &AElig;olis terminates. Such then is the nature
of the country.</p>

<p>The poet implies that it was the Trojans chiefly who were
divided into eight or even nine bodies of people, each forming
a petty princedom, who had under their sway the places
about &AElig;sepus, and those about the territory of the present
Cyzicene, as far as the river Ca&iuml;cus. The troops of auxiliaries
are reckoned among the allies.</p>

<p>3. The writers subsequent to Homer do not assign the
same boundaries, but introduce other names, and a greater
number of territorial divisions. The Greek colonies were the
cause of this; the Ionian migration produced less change,
for it was further distant from the Troad, but the &AElig;olian
colonists occasioned it throughout, for they were dispersed
over the whole of the country from Cyzicene as far as
the Ca&iuml;cus, and occupied besides the district between the
Ca&iuml;cus and the river Hermus. It is said that the &AElig;olian
preceded the Ionian migration four generations, but it was attended
with delays, and the settlement of the colonies took up
a longer time. Orestes was the leader of the colonists, and
died in Arcadia. He was preceded by his son Penthilus,
who advanced as far as Thrace, sixty years<a name="FNanchor_1319" id="FNanchor_1319"></a><a href="#Footnote_1319" class="fnanchor">1319</a> after the Trojan
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]<br />[CAS. 582]</a></span>
war, about the time of the return of the Heracleid&aelig; to Peloponnesus.
Then Archelaus the son of Penthilus conducted
the &AElig;olian colonies across the sea to the present Cyzicene,
near Dascylium. Gras his youngest son proceeded as far as
the river Granicus, and, being provided with better means,
transported the greater part of those who composed the expedition
to Lesbos, and took possession of it.</p>

<p>On the other side, Cleuas, the son of Dorus, and Malaus,
who were descendants of Agamemnon, assembled a body of
men for an expedition about the same time as Penthilus, but
the band of Penthilus passed over from Thrace into Asia before
them; while the rest consumed much time near Locris,
and the mountain Phricius. At last however they crossed the
sea, and founded Cyme, to which they gave the name of Phriconis,
from Phricius, the Locrian mountain.</p>

<p>4. The &AElig;olians then were dispersed over the whole country,
which we have said the poet calls the Trojan country.
Later writers give this name to the whole, and others to a part,
of &AElig;olis; and so, with respect to Troja, some writers understand
the whole, others only a part, of that country, not entirely
agreeing with one another in anything.</p>

<p>According to Homer, the commencement of the Troad is at
the places on the Propontis, reckoning it from the &AElig;sepus.
According to Eudoxus, it begins from Priapus, and Artace,
situated in the island of the Cyziceni opposite to Priapus, and
thus he contracts the boundaries [of the Troad]. Damastes
contracts them still more by reckoning its commencement
from Parium.<a name="FNanchor_1320" id="FNanchor_1320"></a><a href="#Footnote_1320" class="fnanchor">1320</a> He extends the Troad as far as Lectum. But
different writers assign different limits to this country.
Charon of Lampsacus diminishes its extent by three hundred
stadia more, by reckoning its commencement from Practius,
for this is the distance between Parium and Practius, but
protracts it to Adramyttium. It begins, according to Scylax
of Caryanda, at Abydos. There is the same diversity of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
opinion respecting the boundaries of &AElig;olis. Ephorus reckons
its extent from Abydos to Cyme, but different writers compute
it in different ways.</p>

<p>5. The situation of the country actually called Troja is best
marked by the position of Ida, a lofty mountain, looking to the
west, and to the western sea, but making a slight bend to the
north and towards the northern coast. This latter is the coast
of the Propontis, extending from the straits near Abydos to
the &AElig;sepus, and to the territory of Cyzicene. The western
sea is the exterior (part of the) Hellespont, and the &AElig;g&aelig;an
Sea.</p>

<p>Ida has many projecting parts like feet, and resembles in
figure a tarantula, and is bounded by the following extreme
points, namely, the promontory<a name="FNanchor_1321" id="FNanchor_1321"></a><a href="#Footnote_1321" class="fnanchor">1321</a> at Zeleia, and that called Lectum;
the former terminates in the inland parts a little above
Cyzicene (to the Cyziceni belongs the present Zeleia), and Lectum
projects into the &AElig;g&aelig;an Sea, and is met with in the coasting
voyage from Tenedos to Lesbos.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;They (namely, Somnus and Juno) came, says Homer, to Ida, abounding
with springs, the nurse of wild beasts, to Lectum where first they
left the sea,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1322" id="FNanchor_1322"></a><a href="#Footnote_1322" class="fnanchor">1322</a></p>

<p>where the poet describes Lectum in appropriate terms, for he
says correctly that Lectum is a part of Ida, and that this was
the first place of disembarkation for persons intending to
ascend Mount Ida.<a name="FNanchor_1323" id="FNanchor_1323"></a><a href="#Footnote_1323" class="fnanchor">1323</a> [He is exact in the epithet &#8220;abounding
with springs;&#8221; for the mountain, especially in that part, has
a very large supply of water, which appears from the great
number of rivers which issue from it;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;all the rivers which rise in Ida, and proceed to the sea, the Rhesus, and
Heptaporus,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1324" id="FNanchor_1324"></a><a href="#Footnote_1324" class="fnanchor">1324</a></p>

<p>and others, which he mentions afterwards, and which are now
to be seen by us.]</p>

<p>In speaking of the projections like feet on each side of
Ida, as Lectum, and Zeleia,<a name="FNanchor_1325" id="FNanchor_1325"></a><a href="#Footnote_1325" class="fnanchor">1325</a> he distinguishes in proper terms
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]<br />[CAS. 584]</a></span>
the summit Gargarum,<a name="FNanchor_1326" id="FNanchor_1326"></a><a href="#Footnote_1326" class="fnanchor">1326</a> calling it the top<a name="FNanchor_1327" id="FNanchor_1327"></a><a href="#Footnote_1327" class="fnanchor">1327</a> (of Ida), for there
is now in existence in the higher parts of Ida a place, from
which the present Gargara, an &AElig;olian city, has its name.
Between Zeleia and Lectum, proceeding from the Propontis, are
first the parts extending to the straits at Abydos. Then the
parts below the Propontis, extending as far as Lectum.</p>

<p>6. On doubling Lectum a large bay opens,<a name="FNanchor_1328" id="FNanchor_1328"></a><a href="#Footnote_1328" class="fnanchor">1328</a> formed by
Mount Ida, which recedes from Lectum, and by Can&aelig;, the
promontory opposite to Lectum on the other side. Some persons
call it the Bay of Ida, others the Bay of Adramyttium.
On this bay are situated the cities of the &AElig;olians, extending,
as we have said, to the mouths of the Hermus. I have
mentioned also in a former part of my work, that in sailing
from Byzantium in a straight line towards the south, we first
arrive at Sestos and Abydos through the middle of the Propontis;
then at the sea-coast of Asia as far as Caria. The
readers of this work ought to attend to the following observation;
although we mention certain bays on this coast, they
must understand the promontories also which form them,
situated on the same meridian.<a name="FNanchor_1329" id="FNanchor_1329"></a><a href="#Footnote_1329" class="fnanchor">1329</a></p>

<p>7. Those who have paid particular attention to this subject
conjecture, from the expressions of the poet, that all
this coast was subject to the Trojans, when it was divided
into nine dynasties, but that at the time of the war it was
under the sway of Priam, and called Troja. This appears
from the detail. Achilles and his army perceiving, at the beginning
of the war, that the inhabitants of Ilium were defended
by walls, carried on the war beyond them, made a circuit,
and took the places about the country;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;I sacked with my ships twelve cities, and eleven in the fruitful land of
Troja.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1330" id="FNanchor_1330"></a><a href="#Footnote_1330" class="fnanchor">1330</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span></p>

<p>By Troja he means the continent which he had ravaged.
Among other places which had been plundered, was the
country opposite Lesbos,&mdash;that about Thebe, Lyrnessus, and
Pedasus belonging to the Leleges, and the territory also of
Eurypylus, the son of Telephus;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;as when he slew with his sword the hero Eurypylus, the son of Telephus;&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1331" id="FNanchor_1331"></a><a href="#Footnote_1331" class="fnanchor">1331</a></p>

</div></div></div>

<p>In the capture of this place the poet says, Mynes and Epistrophus
were slain, as Brise&iuml;s mentions in her lament over Patroclus,</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;Thou didst not permit me, when the swift-footed Achilles slew my husband,

<p>for by calling Lyrnessus &#8220;the city of the divine Mynes,&#8221; the
poet implies that it was governed by him who was killed
fighting in its defence.</p>

<p>Chryse&iuml;s was carried away from Thebe;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

but by a transposition; &#8220;both born in Troja, thou in the

<p>then the Lycians under the command of Pandarus he calls
Trojans;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;Aphneian Trojans, who inhabited Zeleia at the farthest extremity of
Ida, who drink of the dark waters of &AElig;sepus, these were led by Pandarus,
the illustrious son of Lycaon.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1343" id="FNanchor_1343"></a><a href="#Footnote_1343" class="fnanchor">1343</a></p>

<p>This is the sixth dynasty.</p>

<p>The people, also, who lived between the &AElig;sepus and Abydos
were Trojans, for the country about Abydos was governed
by Asius;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;those who dwelt about Percote and Practius, at Sestos, Abydos, and
the noble Arisbe, were led by Asius, the son of Hyrtacus.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1344" id="FNanchor_1344"></a><a href="#Footnote_1344" class="fnanchor">1344</a></p>

<p>Now it is manifest that a son of Priam, who had the care of
his father&#8217;s brood mares, dwelt at Abydos;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;he wounded the spurious son of Priam, Democoon, who came from
Abydos from the pastures of the swift mares.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1345" id="FNanchor_1345"></a><a href="#Footnote_1345" class="fnanchor">1345</a></p>

<p>At Percote,<a name="FNanchor_1346" id="FNanchor_1346"></a><a href="#Footnote_1346" class="fnanchor">1346</a> the son of Hicetaon was the herdsman of oxen,
but not of those belonging to strangers;</p>

tending the oxen in their pastures at Percote.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1347" id="FNanchor_1347"></a><a href="#Footnote_1347" class="fnanchor">1347</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span></p>

<p>so that this country also was part of the Troad, and the subsequent
tract as far as Adrasteia, for it was governed by</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;the two sons of Merops of Percote.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1348" id="FNanchor_1348"></a><a href="#Footnote_1348" class="fnanchor">1348</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>All therefore were Trojans from Abydos to Adrasteia, divided,
however, into two bodies, one governed by Asius, the
other by the Meropid&aelig;, as the country of the Cilicians is divided
into the Thebaic and the Lyrnessian Cilicia. To this
district may have belonged the country under the sway of
Eurypylus, for it follows next to the Lyrnessis, or territory of
Lyrnessus.<a name="FNanchor_1349" id="FNanchor_1349"></a><a href="#Footnote_1349" class="fnanchor">1349</a></p>

<p>That Priam<a name="FNanchor_1350" id="FNanchor_1350"></a><a href="#Footnote_1350" class="fnanchor">1350</a> was king of all these countries the words with
which Achilles addresses him clearly show;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;we have heard, old man, that your riches formerly consisted in what
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]<br />[CAS. 586]</a></span>
Lesbos, the city of Macar, contained, and Phrygia above it and the vast
Hellespont.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1351" id="FNanchor_1351"></a><a href="#Footnote_1351" class="fnanchor">1351</a></p>

<p>8. Such was the state of the country at that time. Afterwards
changes of various kinds ensued. Phrygians occupied
the country about Cyzicus as far as Practius; Thracians, the
country about Abydos; and Bebryces and Dryopes, before the
time of both these nations. The next tract of country was
occupied by Treres, who were also Thracians; the plain of
Thebe, by Lydians, who were then called M&aelig;onians, and by
the survivors of the Mysians, who were formerly governed by
Telephus and Teuthoras.</p>

<p>Since then the poet unites together &AElig;olis and Troja, and
since the &AElig;olians occupied all the country from the Hermus
as far as the sea-coast at Cyzicus, and founded cities, we shall
not do wrong in combining in one description &AElig;olis, properly
so called, (extending from the Hermus to Lectum,) and the
tract which follows, as far as the &AElig;sepus; distinguishing them
again in speaking of them separately, and comparing what
is said of them by Homer and by other writers with their present
state.</p>

<p>9. According to Homer, the Troad begins from the city
Cyzicus and the river &AElig;sepus. He speaks of it in this
manner:</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;Aphneian Trojans, who inhabited Zeleia at the farthest extremity of
Ida, who drink the dark waters of &AElig;sepus, these were led by Pandarus,
the illustrious son of Lycaon.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1352" id="FNanchor_1352"></a><a href="#Footnote_1352" class="fnanchor">1352</a></p>

<p>These people he calls also Lycians. They had the name of
Aphneii, it is thought, from the lake Aphnitis, for this is the
name of the lake Dascylitis.</p>

<p>10. Now Zeleia is situated at the farthest extremity of the
country lying at the foot of Ida, and is distant 190 stadia
from Cyzicus, and about 80<a name="FNanchor_1353" id="FNanchor_1353"></a><a href="#Footnote_1353" class="fnanchor">1353</a> from the nearest sea, into which
the &AElig;sepus discharges itself.</p>

<p>The poet then immediately gives in detail the parts of the
sea-coast which follow the &AElig;sepus;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;those who occupied Adrasteia, and the territory of Ap&aelig;sus, and Pityeia
and the lofty mountain Tereia, these were commanded by Adrastus, and
Amphius with the linen corslet, the two sons of Merops of Percote,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1354" id="FNanchor_1354"></a><a href="#Footnote_1354" class="fnanchor">1354</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span></p>

<p>These places lie below Zeleia, and are occupied by Cyziceni,
and Priapeni as far as the sea-coast. The river Tarsius<a name="FNanchor_1355" id="FNanchor_1355"></a><a href="#Footnote_1355" class="fnanchor">1355</a>
runs near Zeleia; it is crossed twenty times on the same road,
like the Heptaporus, mentioned by the poet, which is crossed
seven times. The river flowing from Nicomedia to Nic&aelig;a is
crossed four-and-twenty times; the river which flows from
Pholoe to Eleia, several times; [that flowing from * * * * to
Scardon,<a name="FNanchor_1356" id="FNanchor_1356"></a><a href="#Footnote_1356" class="fnanchor">1356</a>] five-and-twenty times; that running from Coscinii
to Alabanda, in many places, and the river flowing from Tyana
through the Taurus to Soli, is crossed seventy-five times.</p>

<p>11. Above the mouth of the &AElig;sepus about * * stadia is a
hill on which is seen the sepulchre of Memnon, the son of
Tithonus. Near it is the village of Memnon. Between the
&AElig;sepus and Priapus flows the Granicus, but for the most
part it flows through the plain of Adrasteia, where Alexander
defeated in a great battle the satraps of Dareius, and obtained
possession of all the country within the Taurus and the Euphrates.</p>

<p>On the banks of the Granicus was the city Sidene, with a
large territory of the same name. It is now in ruins.</p>

<p>Upon the confines of Cyzicene and Priapene is Harpagia, a
place from which, so says the fable, Ganymede was taken
away by force. Others say that it was at the promontory
Dardanium, near Dardanus.</p>

<p>12. Priapus is a city on the sea, with a harbour. Some
say that it was built by Milesians, who, about the same time,
founded Abydos and Proconnesus; others, that it was built
by Cyziceni. It has its name from Priapus,<a name="FNanchor_1357" id="FNanchor_1357"></a><a href="#Footnote_1357" class="fnanchor">1357</a> who is worshipped
there; either because his worship was transferred
thither from Orne&aelig; near Corinth, or the inhabitants were
disposed to worship him because the god was said to be the
son of Bacchus and a nymph, for their country abounds with
vines, as also the country on their confines, namely, the territory
of the Pariani and of the Lampsaceni. It was for this reason
that Xerxes assigned Lampsacus<a name="FNanchor_1358" id="FNanchor_1358"></a><a href="#Footnote_1358" class="fnanchor">1358</a> to Themistocles to supply
him with wine.</p>

<p>It was in later times that Priapus was considered as a god.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]<br />[CAS. 588]</a></span>
Hesiod for instance knew nothing of Priapus, and he resembles
the Athenian gods Orthane, Conisalus, Tychon, and
others such as these.</p>

<p>13. This district was called Adrasteia, and the plain of
Adrasteia, according to the custom of giving two names to the
same place, as Thebe, and the plain of Thebe; Mygdonia,
and the plain of Mygdonia.</p>

<p>Callisthenes says that Adrasteia had its name from King
Adrastus, who first built the temple of Nemesis. The city
Adrasteia is situated between Priapus and Parium, with a
plain of the same name below it, in which there was an oracle
of the Act&aelig;an Apollo and Artemis near the sea-shore.<a name="FNanchor_1359" id="FNanchor_1359"></a><a href="#Footnote_1359" class="fnanchor">1359</a> On
the demolition of the temple, all the furniture and the stone-work
were transported to Parium, where an altar, the workmanship
of Hermocreon, remarkable for its size and beauty,
was erected, but the oracle, as well as that at Zeleia, was
abolished. No temple either of Adrasteia or Nemesis exists.
But there is a temple of Adrasteia near Cyzicus. Antimachus,
however, says,</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;There is a great goddess Nemesis, who has received all these things
from the immortals. Adrastus first raised an altar to her honour on the
banks of the river &AElig;sepus, where she is worshipped under the name of
Adrasteia.&#8221;</p>

<p>14. The city of Parium lies upon the sea, with a harbour
larger than that of Priapus, and has been augmented from the
latter city; for the Pariani paid court to the Attalic kings,
to whom Priapene was subject, and, by their permission, appropriated
to themselves a large part of that territory.</p>

<p>It is here the story is related that the Ophiogeneis have
some affinity with the serpent tribe (&#964;&#959;&#8058;&#962; &#8004;&#966;&#949;&#953;&#962;). They say
that the males of the Ophiogeneis have the power of curing
persons bitten by serpents by touching them without intermission,
after the manner of the enchanters. They first
transfer to themselves the livid colour occasioned by the bite,
and then cause the inflammation and pain to subside. According
to the fable, the founder of the race of Ophiogeneis, a
hero, was transformed from a serpent into a man. He was
perhaps one of the African Psylli. The power continued in
the race for some time.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span></p>

<p>Parium was founded by Milesians, Erythr&aelig;ans, and Parians.</p>

<p>15. Pitya is situated in Pityus in the Parian district, and
having above it a mountain abounding with pine trees (&#960;&#953;&#964;&#965;&#8182;&#948;&#949;&#962;);
it is between Parium and Priapus, near Linum, a
place upon the sea, where the Linusian cockles are taken,
which excel all others.</p>

<p>16. In the voyage along the coast from Parium to Priapus
are the ancient and the present Proconnesus,<a name="FNanchor_1360" id="FNanchor_1360"></a><a href="#Footnote_1360" class="fnanchor">1360</a> with a city, and
a large quarry of white marble, which is much esteemed.
The most beautiful works in the cities in these parts, and particularly
those in Cyzicus, are constructed of this stone.</p>

<p>Aristeas, the writer of the poems called Arimaspeian, the
greatest of impostors, was of Proconnesus.</p>

<p>17. With respect to the mountain Tereia, some persons say
that it is the range of mountains in Peirossus, which the Cyziceni
occupy, contiguous to Zeleia, among which was a royal
chase for the Lydian, and afterwards for the Persian, kings.
Others say that it was a hill forty stadia from Lampsacus, on
which was a temple sacred to the mother of the gods, surnamed
Tereia.</p>

<p>18. Lampsacus, situated on the sea, is a considerable city
with a good harbour, and, like Abydos, supports its state
well. It is distant from Abydos about 170 stadia. It had
formerly, as they say Chios had, the name of Pityusa. On
the opposite territory in Cherronesus is Callipolis,<a name="FNanchor_1361" id="FNanchor_1361"></a><a href="#Footnote_1361" class="fnanchor">1361</a> a small
town. It is situated upon the shore, which projects so far
towards Asia opposite to Lampsacus that the passage across
does not exceed 40 stadia.</p>

<p>19. In the interval between Lampsacus and Parium was
P&aelig;sus, a city, and a river P&aelig;sus.<a name="FNanchor_1362" id="FNanchor_1362"></a><a href="#Footnote_1362" class="fnanchor">1362</a> The city was razed, and
the P&aelig;seni, who, as well as the Lampsaceni, were a colony of
Milesians, removed to Lampsacus. The poet mentions the
city with the addition of the first syllable,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;and the country of Ap&aelig;sus;&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1363" id="FNanchor_1363"></a><a href="#Footnote_1363" class="fnanchor">1363</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>and without it,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;a man of great possessions, who lived at P&aelig;sus;&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1364" id="FNanchor_1364"></a><a href="#Footnote_1364" class="fnanchor">1364</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>and this is still the name of the river.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]<br />[CAS. 589]</a></span></p>

<p>Colon&aelig; also is a colony of Milesians. It is situated above
Lampsacus, in the interior of the territory Lampsacene.
There is another Colon&aelig; situated upon the exterior Hellespontic
Sea, at the distance of 140 stadia from Ilium; the
birth-place, it is said, of Cycnus. Anaximenes mentions a
Colon&aelig; in the Erythr&aelig;an territory, in Phocis, and in Thessaly.
Iliocolone is in the Parian district. In Lampsacene is
a place well planted with vines, called Gergithium, and there
was a city Gergitha, founded by the Gergithi in the Cym&aelig;an
territory, where formerly was a city called Gergitheis, (used
in the plural number, and of the feminine gender,) the birthplace
of Cephalon<a name="FNanchor_1365" id="FNanchor_1365"></a><a href="#Footnote_1365" class="fnanchor">1365</a> the Gergithian, and even now there exists a
place in the Cym&aelig;an territory called Gergithium, near Larissa.</p>

<p>Neoptolemus,<a name="FNanchor_1366" id="FNanchor_1366"></a><a href="#Footnote_1366" class="fnanchor">1366</a> surnamed the Glossographer, a writer of repute,
was of Parium. Charon,<a name="FNanchor_1367" id="FNanchor_1367"></a><a href="#Footnote_1367" class="fnanchor">1367</a> the Historian, was of Lampsacus.
Adeimantes,<a name="FNanchor_1368" id="FNanchor_1368"></a><a href="#Footnote_1368" class="fnanchor">1368</a> Anaximenes,<a name="FNanchor_1369" id="FNanchor_1369"></a><a href="#Footnote_1369" class="fnanchor">1369</a> the Rhetorician, and Metrodorus,
the friend of Epicurus, even Epicurus himself might be said
to be a Lampsacenian, having lived a long time at Lampsacus,
and enjoyed the friendship of Idomeneus and Leontes, the
most distinguished of its citizens.</p>

<p>It was from Lampsacus that Agrippa transported the
Prostrate Lion, the workmanship of Lysippus, and placed it
in the sacred grove between the lake<a name="FNanchor_1370" id="FNanchor_1370"></a><a href="#Footnote_1370" class="fnanchor">1370</a> and the strait.</p>

<p>20. Next to Lampsacus is Abydos, and the intervening
places, of which the poet speaks in such a manner as to comprehend
both Lampsacene and some parts of Pariane, for, in
the Trojan times, the above cities were not yet in existence:</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;those who inhabited Percote, Practius, Sestos, Abydos, and the famed
Arisbe, were led by Asius, the son of Hyrtacus,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1371" id="FNanchor_1371"></a><a href="#Footnote_1371" class="fnanchor">1371</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span></p>

<p>who, he says,</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;came from Arisbe, from the river Selle&iuml;s in a chariot drawn by large
and furious coursers;&#8221;</p>

<p>implying by these words that Arisbe was the royal seat of
Asius, whence, he says, he came,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;drawn by coursers from the river Selle&iuml;s.&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But these places are so little known, that writers do not agree
among themselves about their situation, except that they are
near Abydos, Lampsacus, and Parium, and that the name of
the last place was changed from Percope to Percote.</p>

<p>21. With respect to the rivers, the poet says that the Selle&iuml;s
flows near Arisbe, for Asius came from Arisbe and the
river Selle&iuml;s. Practius is a river, but no city of that name, as
some have thought, is to be found. This river runs between
Abydos and Lampsacus; the words, therefore,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;and dwelt near Practius,&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>must be understood of the river, as these expressions of the
poet,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;they dwelt near the sacred waters of Cephisus,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1372" id="FNanchor_1372"></a><a href="#Footnote_1372" class="fnanchor">1372</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>and</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;they occupied the fertile land about the river Parthenius.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1373" id="FNanchor_1373"></a><a href="#Footnote_1373" class="fnanchor">1373</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>There was also in Lesbos a city called Arisba, the territory
belonging to which was possessed by the Methymn&aelig;ans.
There is a river Arisbus in Thrace, as we have said before,
near which are situated the Cabrenii Thracians. There are
many names common to Thracians and Trojans, as Sc&aelig;i, a
Thracian tribe, a river Sc&aelig;us, a Sc&aelig;an wall, and in Troy,
Sc&aelig;an gates. There are Thracians called Xanthii, and a river
Xanthus in Troja; an Arisbus which discharges itself into the
Hebrus,<a name="FNanchor_1374" id="FNanchor_1374"></a><a href="#Footnote_1374" class="fnanchor">1374</a> and an Arisbe in Troja; a river Rhesus in Troja,
and Rhesus, a king of the Thracians. The poet mentions
also another Asius, besides the Asius of Arisbe,</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;who was the maternal uncle of the hero Hector, own brother of Hecuba,
and son of Dymas who lived in Phrygia on the banks of the Sangarius.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1375" id="FNanchor_1375"></a><a href="#Footnote_1375" class="fnanchor">1375</a></p>

<p>22. Abydos was founded by Milesians by permission of
Gyges, king of Lydia; for those places and the whole of the
Troad were under his sway. There is a promontory near</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]<br />[CAS. 591]</a></span></p><p>Dardanus called Gyges. Abydos is situated upon the mouth
of the Propontis and the Hellespont, and is at an equal distance
from Lampsacus and Ilium, about 170 stadia. At Abydos
is the Hepta Stadium, (or strait of seven stadia,) the shores
of which Xerxes united by a bridge. It separates Europe
from Asia. The extremity of Europe is called Cherronesus,
from its figure; it forms the straits at the Zeugma (or Junction)<a name="FNanchor_1376" id="FNanchor_1376"></a><a href="#Footnote_1376" class="fnanchor">1376</a>
which is opposite to Abydos.</p>

<p>Sestos is the finest<a name="FNanchor_1377" id="FNanchor_1377"></a><a href="#Footnote_1377" class="fnanchor">1377</a> city in the Cherronesus, and from its
proximity to Abydos was placed under the command of the
same governor, at a time when the same limits were not assigned
to the governments and to the continents. Sestos and
Abydos are distant from each other, from harbour to harbour,
about 30 stadia. The Zeugma is a little beyond the cities;
on the side of the Propontis, beyond Abydos, and on the opposite
side, beyond Sestos. There is a place near Sestos,
called Apobathra, where the raft was fastened. Sestos lies
nearer the Propontis, and above the current which issues from
it; whence the passage is more easy from Sestos by deviating
a little towards the tower of Hero, when, letting the vessel go
at liberty, the stream assists in effecting the crossing to the
other side. In crossing from Abydos to the other side persons
must sail out in the contrary direction, to the distance of about
eight stadia towards a tower which is opposite Sestos; they
must then take an oblique course, and the current will not be
entirely against them.</p>

<p>After the Trojan war, Abydos was inhabited by Thracians,
then by Milesians. When the cities on the Propontis were
burnt by Dareius, father of Xerxes, Abydos shared in the
calamity. Being informed, after his return from Scythia,
that the Nomades were preparing to cross over to attack him,
in revenge for the treatment which they had experienced, he
set fire to these cities, apprehending that they would assist in
transporting the Scythian army across the strait.</p>

<p>In addition to other changes of this kind, those occasioned
by time are a cause of confusion among places.</p>

<p>We spoke before of Sestos, and of the whole of the Cherronesus,
when we described Thrace. Theopompus says that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
Sestos is a small but well-fortified place, and is connected
with the harbour by a wall of two plethra in extent, and for
this reason, and by its situation above the current, it commands
the passage of the strait.</p>

<p>23. In the Troad, above the territory of Abydos is Astyra,
which now belongs to the Abydeni,&mdash;a city in ruins, but it
was formerly an independent place, and had gold-mines,
which are now nearly exhausted, like those in Mount Tmolus
near the Pactolus.</p>

<p>From Abydos to the &AElig;sepus are, it is said, about 700
stadia, but not so much in sailing in a direct line.</p>

<p>24. Beyond Abydos are the parts about Ilium, the sea-coast
as far as Lectum, the places in the Trojan plain, and
the country at the foot of Ida, which was subject to &AElig;neas.
The poet names the Dardanii in two ways, speaking of them
as</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;Dardanii governed by the brave son of Anchises,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1378" id="FNanchor_1378"></a><a href="#Footnote_1378" class="fnanchor">1378</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>calling them Dardanii, and also Dardani;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;Troes, and Lycii, and close-fighting Dardani.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1379" id="FNanchor_1379"></a><a href="#Footnote_1379" class="fnanchor">1379</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>It is probable that the Dardania,<a name="FNanchor_1380" id="FNanchor_1380"></a><a href="#Footnote_1380" class="fnanchor">1380</a> so called by the poet,
was anciently situated there;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;Dardanus, the son of cloud-compelling Jupiter, founded Dardania:&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1381" id="FNanchor_1381"></a><a href="#Footnote_1381" class="fnanchor">1381</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>at present there is not a vestige of a city.</p>

<p>25. Plato conjectures that, after the deluges, three kinds
of communities were established; the first on the heights of
the mountains, consisting of a simple and savage race, who
had taken refuge there through dread of the waters, which
overflowed the plains; the second, at the foot of the mountains,
who regained courage by degrees, as the plains began
to dry; the third, in the plains. But a fourth, and perhaps
a fifth, or more communities might be supposed to be
formed, the last of which might be on the sea-coast, and
in the islands, after all fear of deluge was dissipated. For
as men approached the sea with a greater or less degree
of courage, we should have greater variety in forms of
government, diversity also in manners and habits, according
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]<br />[CAS. 593]</a></span>
as a simple and savage people assumed the milder character
of the second kind of community. There is, however,
a distinction to be observed even among these, as of
rustic, half rustic, and of civilized people. Among these
finally arose a gradual change, and an assumption of names,
applied to polished and high character, the result of an improved
moral condition produced by a change of situation
and mode of life. Plato says that the poet describes these
differences, alleging as an example of the first form of society
the mode of life among the Cyclops, who subsisted on the
fruits of the earth growing spontaneously, and who occupied
certain caves in the heights of mountains;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;all things grow there,&#8221; he says, &#8220;without sowing seed, and without the
plough.</p>

<p class="small">But they have no assemblies for consulting together, nor administration
of laws, but live on the heights of lofty mountains, in deep caves, and
each gives laws to his wife and children.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1382" id="FNanchor_1382"></a><a href="#Footnote_1382" class="fnanchor">1382</a></p>

<p>As an example of the second form of society, he alleges
the mode of life under Dardanus;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;he founded Dardania; for sacred Ilium was not yet a city in the plain
with inhabitants, but they still dwelt at the foot of Ida abounding with
streams.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1383" id="FNanchor_1383"></a><a href="#Footnote_1383" class="fnanchor">1383</a></p>

<p>An example of the third state of society is taken from that
in the time of Ilus, when the people inhabited the plains. He
is said to have been the founder of Ilium, from whom the
city had its name. It is probable that for this reason he was
buried in the middle of the plain, because he first ventured to
make a settlement in it,</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;they rushed through the middle of the plain by the wild fig-tree near
the tomb of ancient Ilus, the son of Dardanus.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1384" id="FNanchor_1384"></a><a href="#Footnote_1384" class="fnanchor">1384</a></p>

<p>He did not, however, place entire confidence in the situation,
for he did not build the city where it stands at present, but
nearly thirty stadia higher to the east, towards Ida, and
Dardania, near the present village of the Ilienses. The present
Ilienses are ambitious of having it supposed that theirs is
the ancient city, and have furnished a subject of discussion to
those who form their conjectures from the poetry of Homer;
but it does not seem to be the city meant by the poet. Other
writers also relate, that the city had frequently changed its
place, but at last about the time of Cr&#339;sus it became stationary.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
Such changes, which then took place, from higher to
lower situations, mark the differences, I conceive, which followed
in the forms of government and modes of life. But
we must examine this subject elsewhere.</p>

<p>26. The present city of Ilium was once, it is said, a village,
containing a small and plain temple of Minerva; that Alexander,
after<a name="FNanchor_1385" id="FNanchor_1385"></a><a href="#Footnote_1385" class="fnanchor">1385</a> his victory at the Granicus, came up, and decorated
the temple with offerings, gave it the title of city, and
ordered those who had the management of such things to improve
it with new buildings; he declared it free and exempt
from tribute. Afterwards, when he had destroyed the Persian
empire, he sent a letter, expressed in kind terms, in which he
promised the Ilienses to make theirs a great city, to build a
temple of great magnificence, and to institute sacred games.</p>

<p>After the death of Alexander, it was Lysimachus who
took the greatest interest in the welfare of the place; built
a temple, and surrounded the city with a wall of about 40
stadia in extent. He settled here the inhabitants of the ancient
cities around, which were in a dilapidated state. It was
at this time that he directed his attention to Alexandreia,
founded by Antigonus, and surnamed Antigonia, which was
altered (into Alexandreia). For it appeared to be an act of
pious duty in the successors of Alexander first to found cities
which should bear his name, and afterwards those which should
be called after their own. Alexandreia continued to exist, and
became a large place; at present it has received a Roman
colony, and is reckoned among celebrated cities.</p>

<p>27. The present Ilium was a kind of village-city, when
the Romans first came into Asia and expelled Antiochus the
Great from the country within the Taurus. Demetrius of Scepsis
says that, when a youth, he came, in the course of his
travels, to this city, about that time, and saw the houses so
neglected that even the roofs were without tiles. Hegesianax<a name="FNanchor_1386" id="FNanchor_1386"></a><a href="#Footnote_1386" class="fnanchor">1386</a>
also relates, that the Galatians, who crossed over from Europe,
being in want of some stronghold, went up to the city, but
immediately left it, when they saw that it was not fortified
with a wall; afterwards it underwent great reparation and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]<br />[CAS. 595]</a></span>
improvement. It was again injured by the Romans under the
command of Fimbrias. They took it by siege in the Mithridatic
war. Fimbrias was sent as qu&aelig;stor, with the consul
Valerius Flaccus, who was appointed to carry on the war
against Mithridates. But having excited a sedition, and put
the consul to death in Bithynia, he placed himself at the head
of the army and advanced towards Ilium, where the inhabitants
refused to admit him into the city, as they regarded him
as a robber. He had recourse to force, and took the city on the
eleventh day. When he was boasting that he had taken a
city on the eleventh day, which Agamemnon had reduced with
difficulty in the tenth year of the siege with a fleet of a thousand
vessels, and with the aid of the whole of Greece, one of
the Ilienses replied, &#8220;We had no Hector to defend the city.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sylla afterwards came, defeated Fimbrias, and dismissed
Mithridates, according to treaty, into his own territory. Sylla
conciliated the Ilienses by extensive repairs of their city. In
our time divus C&aelig;sar showed them still more favour, in imitation
of Alexander. He was inclined to favour them, for the
purpose of renewing his family connexion with the Ilienses,
and as an admirer of Homer.</p>

<p>There exists a corrected copy of the poems of Homer,
called &#8220;the casket-copy.&#8221; Alexander perused it in company
with Callisthenes and Anaxarchus, and having made some
marks and observations deposited it in a casket<a name="FNanchor_1387" id="FNanchor_1387"></a><a href="#Footnote_1387" class="fnanchor">1387</a> of costly
workmanship which he found among the Persian treasures.
On account then of his admiration of the poet and his descent
from the &AElig;acid&aelig;, (who were kings of the Molossi, whose
queen they say was Andromache, afterwards the wife of
Hector,) Alexander treated the Ilienses with kindness.</p>

<p>But C&aelig;sar, who admired the character of Alexander, and
had strong proofs of his affinity to the Ilienses, had the greatest
possible desire to be their benefactor. The proofs of his
affinity to the Ilienses were strong, first as being a Roman,&mdash;for
the Romans consider &AElig;neas to be the founder of their
race,&mdash;next he had the name of Julius, from Iulus, one of his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
ancestors, a descendant of &AElig;neas. He therefore assigned to
them a district, and guaranteed their liberty with exemption
from imposts, and they continue at present to enjoy these advantages.
They maintain by this evidence that the ancient
Ilium, even by Homer&#8217;s account, was not situated there. I
must however first describe the places which commence from
the sea-coast, where I made the digression.</p>

<p>28. Next to Abydos is the promontory Dardanis,<a name="FNanchor_1388" id="FNanchor_1388"></a><a href="#Footnote_1388" class="fnanchor">1388</a> which
we mentioned a little before, and the city Dardanus, distant
70 stadia from Abydos. Between them the river Rhodius
discharges itself, opposite to which on the Cherronesus is the
Cynossema,<a name="FNanchor_1389" id="FNanchor_1389"></a><a href="#Footnote_1389" class="fnanchor">1389</a> which is said to be the sepulchre of Hecuba.
According to others, the Rhodius empties itself into the
&AElig;sepus. It is one of the rivers mentioned by the poet,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;Rhesus, and Heptaporus, Caresus, and Rhodius.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1390" id="FNanchor_1390"></a><a href="#Footnote_1390" class="fnanchor">1390</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Dardanus is an ancient settlement, but so slightly thought
of, that some kings transferred its inhabitants to Abydos,
others re-settled them in the ancient dwelling-place. Here
Cornelius Sylla, the Roman general, and Mithridates, surnamed
Eupator, conferred together, and terminated the war
by a treaty.</p>

<p>29. Near Dardanus is Ophrynium, on which is the grove
dedicated to Hector in a conspicuous situation, and next is
Pteleos, a lake.</p>

<p>30. Then follows Rh&#339;teium, a city on a hill, and continuous
to it is a shore on a level with the sea, on which is situated
a monument and temple of Ajax, and a statue. Antony took
away the latter and carried it to &AElig;gypt, but Augustus C&aelig;sar
restored it to the inhabitants of Rh&#339;teium, as he restored other
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]<br />[CAS. 595]</a></span>
statues to other cities. Antony took away the most beautiful
offerings from the most celebrated temples to gratify the
&AElig;gyptian queen, but Augustus C&aelig;sar restored them to the
gods.</p>

<p>31. After Rh&#339;teium is Sigeium,<a name="FNanchor_1391" id="FNanchor_1391"></a><a href="#Footnote_1391" class="fnanchor">1391</a> a city in ruins, and the
naval station, the harbour of the Ach&aelig;ans, the Ach&aelig;an camp,
the Stomalimne, as it is called, and the mouths of the Scamander.
The Scamander and the Simoeis, uniting in the plain,<a name="FNanchor_1392" id="FNanchor_1392"></a><a href="#Footnote_1392" class="fnanchor">1392</a>
bring down a great quantity of mud, bank up the sea-coast,
and form a blind mouth, salt-water lakes, and marshes.</p>

<p>Opposite the Sigeian promontory on the Cherronesus is the
Protesilaeium,<a name="FNanchor_1393" id="FNanchor_1393"></a><a href="#Footnote_1393" class="fnanchor">1393</a> and Eleussa, of which I have spoken in the
description of Thrace.</p>

<p>32. The extent of this sea-coast as we sail in a direct line
from Rh&#339;teium to Sigeium, and the monument of Achilles, is
60 stadia. The whole of the coast lies below the present
Ilium; the part near the port of the Ach&aelig;ans,<a name="FNanchor_1394" id="FNanchor_1394"></a><a href="#Footnote_1394" class="fnanchor">1394</a> distant from
the present Ilium about 12 stadia, and thirty stadia more from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
the ancient Ilium,<a name="FNanchor_1395" id="FNanchor_1395"></a><a href="#Footnote_1395" class="fnanchor">1395</a> which is higher up in the part towards
Ida.</p>

<p>Near the Sigeium is a temple and monument of Achilles,
and monuments also of Patroclus and Antilochus.<a name="FNanchor_1396" id="FNanchor_1396"></a><a href="#Footnote_1396" class="fnanchor">1396</a> The
Ilienses perform sacred ceremonies in honour of them all, and
even of Ajax. But they do not worship Hercules, alleging as
a reason that he ravaged their country. Yet some one might
say that he laid it waste in such a manner that he left it to
future spoilers in an injured condition indeed, but still in the
condition of a city; wherefore the poet expresses himself in
this manner,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;He ravaged the city of Ilium, and made its streets desolate,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1397" id="FNanchor_1397"></a><a href="#Footnote_1397" class="fnanchor">1397</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>for desolation implies a deficiency of inhabitants, but not a
complete destruction of the place; but those persons destroyed
it entirely, whom they think worthy of sacred rites, and worship
as gods; unless, perhaps, they should plead that these
persons engaged in a just, and Hercules in an unjust, war, on
account of the horses of Laomedon. To this is opposed a
fabulous tale, that it was not on account of the horses but of
the reward for the delivery of Hesione from the sea-monster.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]<br />[CAS. 596]</a></span>
Let us, however, dismiss this subject, for the discussion leads
to the refutation of fables only, and probably there may be
reasons unknown to us which induced the Ilienses to worship
some of these persons, and not others. The poet seems, in
speaking of Hercules, to represent the city as small, since he
ravaged the city</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;with six ships only, and a small band of men.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1398" id="FNanchor_1398"></a><a href="#Footnote_1398" class="fnanchor">1398</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>From these words it appears that Priam from a small became
a great person, and a king of kings, as we have already said.</p>

<p>A short way from this coast is the Ach&aelig;&iuml;um, situated on
the continent opposite Tenedos.</p>

<p>33. Such, then, is the nature of the places on the sea-coast.
Above them lies the plain of Troy, extending as far as Ida to
the east, a distance of many stadia.<a name="FNanchor_1399" id="FNanchor_1399"></a><a href="#Footnote_1399" class="fnanchor">1399</a> The part at the foot of
the mountain is narrow, extending to the south as far as the
places near Scepsis, and towards the north as far as the Lycians
about Zeleia. This country Homer places under the
command of &AElig;neas and the Antenorid&aelig;, and calls it Dardania.
Below it is Cebrenia, which for the most part consists
of plains, and lies nearly parallel to Dardania. There
was also formerly a city Cybrene. Demetrius (of Scepsis)
supposes that the tract about Ilium, subject to Hector, extended
to this place, from the Naustathmus (or station for
vessels) to Cebrenia, for he says that the sepulchre of Alexander
Paris exists there, and of &#338;none, who, according to
historians, was the wife of Alexander, before the rape of
Helen; the poet says,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;Cebriones, the spurious son of the far-famed Priam,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1400" id="FNanchor_1400"></a><a href="#Footnote_1400" class="fnanchor">1400</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>who, perhaps, received his name from the district, (Cebrenia,)
or, more probably, from the city (Cebrene<a name="FNanchor_1401" id="FNanchor_1401"></a><a href="#Footnote_1401" class="fnanchor">1401</a>). Cebrenia extends
as far as the Scepsian district. The boundary is the
Scamander, which runs through the middle of Cebrenia and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
Scepsia. There was continual enmity and war between the
Scepsians and Cebrenians, till Antigonus settled them both
together in the city, then called Antigonia, but at present
Alexandria. The Cebrenians remained there with the other
inhabitants, but the Scepsians, by the permission of Lysimachus,
returned to their own country.</p>

<p>34. From the mountainous tract of Ida near these places,
two arms, he says, extend to the sea, one in the direction of
Rh&#339;teium, the other of Sigeium, forming a semicircle, and
terminate in the plain at the same distance from the sea as
the present Ilium, which is situated between the extremities
of the above-mentioned arms, whereas the ancient Ilium was
situated at their commencement. This space comprises the
Simo&iuml;sian plain through which the Simoeis runs, and the
Scamandrian plain, watered by the Scamander. This latter
plain is properly the plain of Troy, and Homer makes it the
scene of the greatest part of his battles, for it is the widest of
the two; and there we see the places named by him, the Erineos,
the tomb of &AElig;syetes,<a name="FNanchor_1402" id="FNanchor_1402"></a><a href="#Footnote_1402" class="fnanchor">1402</a> Batieia, and the tomb of Ilus.
With respect to the Scamander and the Simoeis, the former,
after approaching Sigeium, and the latter Rh&#339;teium, unite
their streams a little in front of the present Ilium,<a name="FNanchor_1403" id="FNanchor_1403"></a><a href="#Footnote_1403" class="fnanchor">1403</a> and then
empty themselves near Sigeium, and form as it is called the
Stomalimne. Each of the above-mentioned plains is separated
from the other by a long ridge<a name="FNanchor_1404" id="FNanchor_1404"></a><a href="#Footnote_1404" class="fnanchor">1404</a> which is in a straight line
with the above-mentioned arms;<a name="FNanchor_1405" id="FNanchor_1405"></a><a href="#Footnote_1405" class="fnanchor">1405</a> the ridge begins at the present
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]<br />[CAS. 597]</a></span>
Ilium and is united to it; it extends as far as Cebrenia,
and completes with the arms on each side the letter &#952;.</p>

<p>35. A little above this ridge of land is the village of the
Ilienses, supposed to be the site of the ancient Ilium, at the
distance of 30 stadia from the present city. Ten stadia above
the village of the Ilienses is Callicolone, a hill beside which,
at the distance of five stadia, runs the Simoeis.</p>

<p>The description of the poet is probable. First what he
says of Mars,</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;but on the other side Mars arose, like a black tempest, one while with
a shrill voice calling upon the Trojans from the summit of the citadel, at
another time running along Callicolone beside the Simoeis;&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1406" id="FNanchor_1406"></a><a href="#Footnote_1406" class="fnanchor">1406</a></p>

<p>for since the battle was fought on the Scamandrian plain,
Mars might, according to probability, encourage the men, one
while from the citadel, at another time from the neighbouring
places, the Simoeis and the Callicolone, to which the battle
might extend. But since Callicolone is distant from the
present Ilium 40 stadia, where was the utility of changing
places at so great a distance, where the array of the troops
did not extend? and the words</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;The Lycii obtained by lot the station near Thymbra,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1407" id="FNanchor_1407"></a><a href="#Footnote_1407" class="fnanchor">1407</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span></p>

<p>which agree better with the ancient city, for the plain Thymbra,<a name="FNanchor_1408" id="FNanchor_1408"></a><a href="#Footnote_1408" class="fnanchor">1408</a>
is near, and the river Thymbrius, which runs through
it, discharges itself into the Scamander, near the temple of
Apollo Thymbr&aelig;us, but is distant 50 stadia from the present
Ilium. The Erineos,<a name="FNanchor_1409" id="FNanchor_1409"></a><a href="#Footnote_1409" class="fnanchor">1409</a> a rugged spot abounding with wild
fig-trees, lies below the ancient city, so that Andromache
might say in conformity with such a situation,</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;but place your bands near Erineos, where the city is most accessible to
the enemy, and where they can mount the wall,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1410" id="FNanchor_1410"></a><a href="#Footnote_1410" class="fnanchor">1410</a></p>

<p>but it is very far distant from the present city. The beech-tree
was a little lower than the Erineos; of the former Achilles
says,</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;When I fought with the Ach&aelig;ans Hector was not disposed to urge the
fight away from the wall, but advanced only as far as the Sc&aelig;an gates,
and the beech-tree.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1411" id="FNanchor_1411"></a><a href="#Footnote_1411" class="fnanchor">1411</a></p>

<p>36. Besides, the Naustathmus, which retains its name at
present, is so near the present city that any person may justly
be surprised at the imprudence of the Greeks, and the want of
spirit in the Trojans;&mdash;imprudence on the part of the Greeks,
that they should have left the place for so long a time unfortified
with a wall, in the neighbourhood of so large a city, and
so great a body of men, both inhabitants and auxiliaries; for
the wall, Homer says, was constructed at a late period; or perhaps
no wall was built and the erection and destruction of it,
as Aristotle says, are due to the invention of the poet;&mdash;a want
of spirit on the part of the Trojans, who, after the wall was
built, attacked that, and the Naustathmus, and the vessels
themselves, but had not the courage before there was a wall
to approach and besiege this station, although the distance was
not great, for the Naustathmus is near Sigeium. The Scamander
discharges itelf near this place at the distance of 20
stadia from Ilium.<a name="FNanchor_1412" id="FNanchor_1412"></a><a href="#Footnote_1412" class="fnanchor">1412</a> If any one shall say that the Naustathmus
is the present harbour of the Ach&aelig;ans, he must mean a
place still nearer, distant about twelve stadia from the sea,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]<br />[CAS. 599]</a></span>
which is the extent of the plain in front of the city to the
sea; but he will be in error if he include (in the ancient) the
present plain, which is all alluvial soil brought down by the
rivers,<a name="FNanchor_1413" id="FNanchor_1413"></a><a href="#Footnote_1413" class="fnanchor">1413</a> so that if the interval is 12 stadia at present, it must
have been at that period less in extent by one half. The
story framed by Ulysses, which he tells Eum&aelig;us, implies a
great distance from the Naustathmus to the city;</p>

<p>Polydamas also says,</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;Consider well, my friends, what is to be done, for my advice is to return
now to the city, for we are far from the walls.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1417" id="FNanchor_1417"></a><a href="#Footnote_1417" class="fnanchor">1417</a></p>

<p>Demetrius (of Scepsis) adds the testimony of Hesti&aelig;a<a name="FNanchor_1418" id="FNanchor_1418"></a><a href="#Footnote_1418" class="fnanchor">1418</a> of
Alexandreia, who composed a work on the Iliad of Homer,
and discusses the question whether the scene of the war was
about the present city, and what was the Trojan plain which
the poet mentions as situated between the city and the sea,
for the plain seen in front of the present city is an accumulation
of earth brought down by the rivers, and formed at a
later period.</p>

<p>37. Polites also,</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;who was the scout of the Trojans, trusting to his swiftness of foot, and
who was on the summit of the tomb of the old &AElig;syetes,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1419" id="FNanchor_1419"></a><a href="#Footnote_1419" class="fnanchor">1419</a></p>

<p>was acting absurdly. For although he was seated</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;on the summit of the tomb,&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>yet he might have observed from the much greater height of
the citadel, situated nearly at the same distance, nor would
his swiftness of foot have been required for the purpose of
security, for the tomb of &AElig;syetes, which exists at present on
the road to Alexandreia, is distant five stadia from the citadel.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span></p>

<p>Nor is the course of Hector round the city at all a probable
circumstance, for the present city will not admit of a circuit
round it on account of the continuous ridge of hill, but the
ancient city did allow such a course round it.<a name="FNanchor_1420" id="FNanchor_1420"></a><a href="#Footnote_1420" class="fnanchor">1420</a></p>

<p>38. No trace of the ancient city remains. This might be
expected, for the cities around were devastated, but not entirely
destroyed, whereas when Troy was overthrown from its
foundation all the stones were removed for the reparation of
the other cities. Arch&aelig;anax of Mitylene is said to have fortified
Sigeium with the stones brought from Troy. Sigeium
was taken possession of by the Athenians, who sent Phryno,
the victor in the Olympic games, at the time the Lesbians
advanced a claim to nearly the whole Troad. They had indeed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]<br />[CAS. 600]</a></span>
founded most of the settlements, some of which exist at
present, and others have disappeared. Pittacus of Mitylene,
one of the seven wise men, sailed to the Troad against Phryno,
the Athenian general, and was defeated in a pitched battle.
(It was at this time that the poet Alc&aelig;us, as he himself says,
when in danger in some battle, threw away his arms and fled.
He charged a messenger with injunctions to inform those at
home that Alc&aelig;us was safe, but that he did not bring
away his arms. These were dedicated by the Athenians as
an offering in the temple of Minerva Glaucopis.)<a name="FNanchor_1421" id="FNanchor_1421"></a><a href="#Footnote_1421" class="fnanchor">1421</a> Upon
Phryno&#8217;s proposal to meet in single combat, Pittacus advanced
with his fishing gear,<a name="FNanchor_1422" id="FNanchor_1422"></a><a href="#Footnote_1422" class="fnanchor">1422</a> enclosed his adversary in a
net, pierced him with his three-pronged spear, and despatched
him with a short sword. The war however still continuing,
Periander was chosen arbitrator by both parties, and put an
end to it.</p>

<p>39. Demetrius accuses Tim&aelig;us of falsehood, for saying
that Periander built a wall round the Achilleium out of the
stones brought from Ilium as a protection against the attacks
of the Athenians, and with a view to assist Pittacus; whereas
this place was fortified by the Mitylen&aelig;ans against Sigeium,
but not with stones from Ilium, nor by Periander. For how
should they choose an enemy in arms to be arbitrator?</p>

<p>The Achilleium is a place which contains the monument of
Achilles, and is a small settlement. It was destroyed, as also
Sigeium, by the Ilienses on account of the refractory disposition
of its inhabitants. For all the sea-coast as far as Dardanus
was afterwards, and is at present, subject to them.</p>

<p>Anciently the greatest part of these places were subject to
the &AElig;olians, and hence Ephorus does not hesitate to call all
the country from Abydos to Cume by the name of &AElig;olis.
But Thucydides<a name="FNanchor_1423" id="FNanchor_1423"></a><a href="#Footnote_1423" class="fnanchor">1423</a> says that the Mitylen&aelig;ans were deprived of
the Troad in the Peloponnesian war by the Athenians under
the command of Paches.</p>

<p>40. The present Ilienses affirm that the city was not entirely
demolished when it was taken by the Ach&aelig;ans, nor at
any time deserted. The Locrian virgins began to be sent
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
there, as was the custom every year, a short time afterwards.
This however is not told by Homer. Nor was Homer acquainted
with the violation of Cassandra,<a name="FNanchor_1424" id="FNanchor_1424"></a><a href="#Footnote_1424" class="fnanchor">1424</a> but says that she
was a virgin about that time:</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;He slew Othryoneus, who had lately come to the war from Cabesus, induced
by the glory of the contest, and who sought in marriage the most
beautiful of the daughters of Priam, Cassandra, without a dower.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1425" id="FNanchor_1425"></a><a href="#Footnote_1425" class="fnanchor">1425</a></p>

<p>He does not mention any force having been used, nor does
he attribute the death of Ajax by shipwreck to the wrath of
Minerva, nor to any similar cause, but says, in general terms,
that he was an object of hatred to Minerva, (for she was incensed
against all who had profaned her temple,) and that
Ajax died by the agency of Neptune for his boasting speeches.</p>

<p>The Locrian virgins were sent there when the Persians
were masters of the country.</p>

<p>41. Such is the account of the Ilienses. But Homer
speaks expressly of the demolition of the city:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="line">
&#8220;The day will come when at length sacred Ilium shall perish,<a name="FNanchor_1426" id="FNanchor_1426"></a><a href="#Footnote_1426" class="fnanchor">1426</a></div>
<div class="line">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">After we have destroyed the lofty city of Priam,<a name="FNanchor_1427" id="FNanchor_1427"></a><a href="#Footnote_1427" class="fnanchor">1427</a></div>

</div></div></div>

<p>Of this they produce evidence of the following kind; the
statue of Minerva, which Homer represents as in a sitting
posture, is seen at present to be a standing figure, for he
orders them</p>

statues of Minerva are found in a sitting posture, as those at
Phoc&aelig;a, Massalia, Rome, Chios, and many other cities. But
modern writers, among whom is Lycurgus the rhetorician,
agree that the city was destroyed, for in mentioning the city
of the Ilienses he says, &#8220;who has not heard, when it was
once razed by the Greeks, that it was uninhabited?&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1433" id="FNanchor_1433"></a><a href="#Footnote_1433" class="fnanchor">1433</a></p>

<p>42. It is conjectured that those who afterwards proposed
to rebuild it avoided the spot as inauspicious, either on account
of its calamities, of which it had been the scene, or
whether Agamemnon, according to an ancient custom, had devoted
it to destruction with a curse, as Cr&#339;sus, when he destroyed
Sidene, in which the tyrant Glaucias had taken refuge,
uttered a curse against those who should rebuild its
walls. They therefore abandoned that spot and built a city
elsewhere.</p>

<p>The Astypal&aelig;ans, who were in possession of Rh&#339;teium,
were the first persons that founded Polium near the Simo&iuml;s,
now called Polisma, but not in a secure spot, and hence it
was soon in ruins.</p>

<p>The present settlement, and the temple, were built in the
time of the Lydian kings; but it was not then a city; a long
time afterwards, however, and by degrees, it became, as we
have said, a considerable place.</p>

<p>Hellanicus, in order to gratify the Ilienses, as is his custom,
maintains that the present and the ancient city are the same.
But the district on the extinction of the city was divided by
the possessors of Rh&#339;teium and Sigeium, and the other
neighbouring people among themselves. Upon the rebuilding
of the city, however, they restored it.</p>

<p>43. Ida is thought to be appropriately described by Homer,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
as abounding with springs on account of the multitude of
rivers which issue from it, particularly where Dardania as
far as Scepsis lies at its foot, and the places about Ilium.</p>

<p>Demetrius, who was acquainted with these places, (for he
was a native,) thus speaks of them: &#8220;There is a height of
Ida called Cotylus; it is situated about 120 stadia above
Scepsis, and from it flow the Scamander, the Granicus, and
the &AElig;sepus;<a name="FNanchor_1434" id="FNanchor_1434"></a><a href="#Footnote_1434" class="fnanchor">1434</a> the two last, being the contributions of many
smaller sources, fall into the Propontis, but the Scamander,
which has but a single source, flows towards the west. All
these sources are in the neighbourhood of each other, and are
comprised within a circuit of 20 stadia. The termination of
the &AElig;sepus is farthest distant from its commencement,
namely, about 500 stadia.&#8221;</p>

<p>We may, however, ask why the poet says,</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;They came to the fair fountains, whence burst forth two streams of the
eddying Scamander, one flowing with water warm,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1435" id="FNanchor_1435"></a><a href="#Footnote_1435" class="fnanchor">1435</a></p>

<p>that is, hot; he proceeds, however,</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;around issues vapour as though caused by fire&mdash;the other gushes out in
the summer, cold like hail, or frozen as snow,&#8221;</p>

<p>for no warm springs are now found in that spot, nor is the
source of the Scamander there, but in the mountain, and
there is one source instead of two.<a name="FNanchor_1436" id="FNanchor_1436"></a><a href="#Footnote_1436" class="fnanchor">1436</a> It is probable that the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]<br />[CAS. 602]</a></span>
warm spring has failed, but the cold spring flowing from the
Scamander along a subterraneous channel emerges at this
place; or, because the water was near the Scamander, it was
called the source of that river, for there are several springs,
which are said to be its sources.</p>

<p>44. The Andirus empties itself into the Scamander; a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
river which comes from the district of Caresene, a mountainous
country, in which are many villages. It is well cultivated
by the husbandmen. It adjoins Dardania, and extends as far as
the places about Zeleia and Pityeia. The country, it is said,
had its name from the river Caresus, mentioned by the poet,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;the Rhesus, Heptaporus, Caresus, and Rhodius,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1437" id="FNanchor_1437"></a><a href="#Footnote_1437" class="fnanchor">1437</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>but the city of the same name as the river is in ruins.</p>

<p>Demetrius again says, the river Rhesus is now called
Rhoeites, unless it is the Rhesus which empties itself into
the Granicus.</p>

<p>The Heptaporus, which is called also Polyporus, is crossed
seven times in travelling from the places about Cale Peuce (or
the beautiful pitch tree) to the village Mel&aelig;n&aelig; and to the
Asclepieium, founded by Lysimachus.</p>

<p>Attalus, the first king, gives this account of the beautiful
pitch tree; its circumference, he says, was 24 feet; the
height of the trunk from the root was 67 feet; it then formed
three branches, equally distant from each other; it then contracts
into one head, and here it completes the whole height
of two plethra, and 15 cubits. It is distant from Adramyttium
180 stadia towards the north.</p>

<p>The Caresus flows from Malus, a place situated between
Pal&aelig;scepsis and Ach&aelig;&iuml;um, in front of the isle of Tenedos, and
empties itself into the &AElig;sepus.</p>

<p>The Rhodius flows from Cleandria and Gordus, which are
distant 60 stadia from Cale Peuce, and empties itself into the
&AElig;nius (&AElig;sepus?).</p>

<p>45. In the valley about the &AElig;sepus, on the left of its
course, the first place we meet with is Polichna, a walled
stronghold; then Pal&aelig;scepsis, next Alizonium, a place invented
for the supposed existence of the Halizoni whom we have
mentioned before.<a name="FNanchor_1438" id="FNanchor_1438"></a><a href="#Footnote_1438" class="fnanchor">1438</a> Then Caresus, a deserted city, and Caresene,
and a river of the same name, (Caresus,) which also
forms a considerable valley, but less than that about the &AElig;sepus.
Next follow the plains of Zeleia, and the mountain plains,
which are well cultivated. On the right of the &AElig;sepus, between
Polichna and Pal&aelig;scepsis is Nea-Come,<a name="FNanchor_1439" id="FNanchor_1439"></a><a href="#Footnote_1439" class="fnanchor">1439</a> and Argyria,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]<br />[CAS. 603]</a></span>
(the silver mines,)<a name="FNanchor_1440" id="FNanchor_1440"></a><a href="#Footnote_1440" class="fnanchor">1440</a> which are another fiction framed to support
the same hypothesis, in order that the words of Homer
may be defended,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div></div></div>

<p>Where then is Alybe, or Alope, or in whatever way they
please to play upon the name? For they ought to have had
the impudence to invent this place also, and not to leave their
system imperfect and exposed to detection, when they had
once ventured so far. This is the contradiction which may
be given to Demetrius.</p>

<p>As to the rest, we ought at least in the greatest number of
instances to attend to a man of experience, and a native of the
country, who also had bestowed so much thought and time on
this subject as to write thirty books to interpret little more
than 60 lines of the catalogue of the Trojan forces.</p>

<p>Pal&aelig;scepsis, according to Demetrius, is distant from &AElig;nea
50, and from the river &AElig;sepus 30, stadia, and the name of
Pal&aelig;scepsis is applied to many other places.<a name="FNanchor_1442" id="FNanchor_1442"></a><a href="#Footnote_1442" class="fnanchor">1442</a></p>

<p>We return to the sea-coast, from which we have digressed.</p>

<p>46. After the Sigeian promontory, and the Achilleium, is
the coast opposite to Tenedos, the Ach&aelig;&iuml;um, and Tenedos itself,
distant not more than 40 stadia from the continent. It is
about 80 stadia in circumference. It contains an &AElig;olian
city, and has two harbours, and a temple of Apollo Smintheus,
as the poet testifies;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;Smintheus, thou that reignest over Tenedos.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1443" id="FNanchor_1443"></a><a href="#Footnote_1443" class="fnanchor">1443</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>There are several small islands around it, and two in particular,
called Calydn&aelig;,<a name="FNanchor_1444" id="FNanchor_1444"></a><a href="#Footnote_1444" class="fnanchor">1444</a> situated in the course of the voyage to
Lectum. There are some writers who call Tenedos Calydna,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
and others Leucophrys.<a name="FNanchor_1445" id="FNanchor_1445"></a><a href="#Footnote_1445" class="fnanchor">1445</a> There are other small islands around
it besides these. They lay near the scene of the fable about
Tennes, from whom the island has its name, and of the story
of Cycnus, a Thracian by descent, and father, according to
some writers, of Tennes, and king of Colon&aelig;.</p>

<p>47. Continuous with the Ach&aelig;ium are Larisa and Colon&aelig;,
formerly belonging to the people of Tenedos, who occupied
the opposite coast; and the present Chrysa, situated upon a
rocky height above the sea, and Hamaxitus lying below, and
close to Lectum. But at present Alexandreia is continuous
with the Ach&aelig;ium; the inhabitants of those small towns, and
of many other strongholds, were embodied in Alexandreia.
Among the latter were Cebrene and Neandria. The territory
is in the possession of the Alexandrini, and the spot in which
Alexandreia is now situated was called Sigia.</p>

<p>48. The temple of Apollo Smintheus is in this Chrysa, and
the symbol, a mouse, which shows the etymology of the epithet
Smintheus, lying under the foot of the statue.<a name="FNanchor_1446" id="FNanchor_1446"></a><a href="#Footnote_1446" class="fnanchor">1446</a> They are
the workmanship of Scopas of Paros. They reconcile the history,
and the fable about the mice, in this following manner.</p>

<p>The Teucri, who came from Crete, (of whom Callinus, the
elegiac poet, gave the first history, and he was followed by
many others,) were directed by an oracle to settle wherever
the earth-born inhabitants should attack them, which, it is
said, occurred to them near Hamaxitus, for in the night-time
great multitudes of field-mice came out and devoured all arms
or utensils which were made of leather; the colony therefore
settled there. These people also called the mountain Ida,
after the name of the mountain in Crete.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]<br />[CAS. 604]</a></span></p>

<p>But Heracleides of Pontus says, that the mice, which
swarmed near the temple, were considered as sacred, and the
statue is represented as standing upon a mouse.</p>

<p>Others say, that a certain Teucer came from Attica, who
belonged to the Demus of Troes, which is now called Xypeteon,
but that no Teucri came from Crete. They adduce as
a proof of the intermixture of Trojans with Athenians, that
an Ericthonius was a founder of both people.</p>

<p>This is the account of modern writers. But the traces
which now exist in the plain of Thebe, and at Chrysa situated
there, coincide better with the description of Homer; and of
these we shall speak immediately.<a name="FNanchor_1447" id="FNanchor_1447"></a><a href="#Footnote_1447" class="fnanchor">1447</a></p>

<p>The name of Smintheus is to be found in many places, for
near Hamaxitus itself, besides the Sminthian Apollo at the
temple, there are two places called Sminthia, and others in the
neighbouring district of Larissa. In the district also of Pariane
is a place called Sminthia; others in Rhodes,<a name="FNanchor_1448" id="FNanchor_1448"></a><a href="#Footnote_1448" class="fnanchor">1448</a> Lindus,
and in many places besides. The temple is now called
Sminthium.</p>

<p>Separate from the other is the Halesian plain near Lectum,
which is not extensive, and the Tragas&aelig;an salt-pan near Hamaxitus,<a name="FNanchor_1449" id="FNanchor_1449"></a><a href="#Footnote_1449" class="fnanchor">1449</a>
where the salt spontaneously concretes on the
blowing of the Etesian winds. On Lectum stands an altar
dedicated to the Twelve Gods, erected, it is said, by Agamemnon.</p>

<p>These places are in sight of Ilium, at the distance of a little
more than 200 stadia. On the other side the parts about
Abydos are visible, although Abydos is somewhat nearer.</p>

<p>49. After doubling Lectum, there follow the most considerable
cities of the &AElig;olians, the bay of Adramyttium, on which
Homer seems to have placed the greater part of the Leleges,
and the Cilicians, divided into two tribes. There also is the
coast of the Mitylen&aelig;ans with some villages of the Mitylen&aelig;ans
on the continent. The bay has the name of the Id&aelig;an
bay, for the ridge extending from Lectum to Ida overhangs
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
the commencement of the bay, where, according to the poet,<a name="FNanchor_1450" id="FNanchor_1450"></a><a href="#Footnote_1450" class="fnanchor">1450</a>
the Leleges were first settled.</p>

<p>50. I have spoken before of the Leleges, and I shall now
add that the poet speaks of a Pedasus, a city of theirs which
was subject to Altes;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;Altes, king of the war-loving Leleges, governs</div>
<div class="line">The lofty Pedasus on the river Satnioeis:&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1451" id="FNanchor_1451"></a><a href="#Footnote_1451" class="fnanchor">1451</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>the spot exists but there is no city. Some read, but incorrectly,
&#8220;below Satnioeis,&#8221; as if the city lay at the foot of a
mountain called Satnioeis; yet there is no mountain there
called Satnioeis, but a river, on which the city is placed. The
city is at present deserted. The poet mentions the river;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;Ajax pierced with his spear Satnius, the son of &#338;nops, whom the beautiful
nymph Na&iuml;s bore to &#338;nops, when he tended herds on the banks of
the Satnioeis.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1452" id="FNanchor_1452"></a><a href="#Footnote_1452" class="fnanchor">1452</a></p>

<p>And in another place;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;&#338;nops dwelt on the banks of the smooth-flowing Satnioeis</div>

</div></div></div>

<p>Later writers called it Satioeis, and some writers Saphnioeis.
It is a great winter torrent, which the poet, by mentioning it,
made remarkable. These places are continuous with the
districts Dardania and Scepsia, and are as it were another
Dardania, but lower than the former.</p>

<p>51. The country comprised in the districts of Antandria,
Cebrene, Neandria, and the Hamaxitus, as far as the sea opposite
to Lesbos, now belongs to the people of Assus and Gargara.<a name="FNanchor_1454" id="FNanchor_1454"></a><a href="#Footnote_1454" class="fnanchor">1454</a></p>

<p>The Neandrians are situated above Hamaxitus on this
side Lectum, but more towards the interior, and nearer to
Ilium, from which they are distant 130 stadia. Above
these people are the Cebrenii, and above the Cebrenii the
Dardanii, extending as far as Pal&aelig;scepsis, and even to
Scepsis.</p>

<p>The poet Alc&aelig;us calls Antandrus a city of the Leleges:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;First is Antandrus, a city of the Leleges.&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Demetrius of Scepsis places it among the adjacent cities, so
that it might be in the country of the Cilicians, for these
people are rather to be regarded as bordering upon the Leleges,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]<br />[CAS. 606]</a></span>
having as their boundary the southern side of Mount
Ida. These however are situated low down, and approach
nearer the sea-coast at Adramyttium. After Lectum, at the
distance of 40 stadia is Polymedium,<a name="FNanchor_1455" id="FNanchor_1455"></a><a href="#Footnote_1455" class="fnanchor">1455</a> a stronghold; then at
the distance of 80 stadia Assus, situated a little above the
sea; next at 140 stadia Gargara, which is situated on a promontory,
which forms the gulf, properly called the gulf of
Adramyttium. For the whole of the sea-coast from Lectum
to Can&aelig;, and the Ela&iuml;tic bay, is comprised under the same
name, the gulf of Adramyttium. This, however, is properly
called the Adramyttene gulf, which is enclosed within the
promontory on which Gargara stands, and that called the
promontory Pyrrha,<a name="FNanchor_1456" id="FNanchor_1456"></a><a href="#Footnote_1456" class="fnanchor">1456</a> on which is a temple of Venus. The
breadth of the entrance forms a passage across from promontory
to promontory of 120 stadia. Within it is Antandrus,<a name="FNanchor_1457" id="FNanchor_1457"></a><a href="#Footnote_1457" class="fnanchor">1457</a>
with a mountain above it, which is called Alexandreia, where
it is said the contest between the goddesses was decided by
Paris; and Aspaneus, the depository of the timber cut from
the forests of Ida; it is here that wood is brought down and
disposed of to those who want it.</p>

<p>Next is Astyra, a village and grove sacred to Artemis Astyrene.
Close to it is Adramyttium, a city founded by a
colony of Athenians, with a harbour, and a station for vessels.
Beyond the gulf and the promontory Pyrrha is Cisthene, a
deserted city with a harbour. Above it in the interior is a
copper mine, Perperena, Trarium, and other similar settlements.</p>

<p>On this coast after Cisthene are the villages of the Mitylen&aelig;ans,
Coryphantis and Heracleia; next to these is Attea;
then Atarneus,<a name="FNanchor_1458" id="FNanchor_1458"></a><a href="#Footnote_1458" class="fnanchor">1458</a> Pitane,<a name="FNanchor_1459" id="FNanchor_1459"></a><a href="#Footnote_1459" class="fnanchor">1459</a> and the mouths of the Ca&iuml;cus. These,
however, belong to the Ela&iuml;tic gulf. On the opposite side of
the Ca&iuml;cus are El&aelig;a,<a name="FNanchor_1460" id="FNanchor_1460"></a><a href="#Footnote_1460" class="fnanchor">1460</a> and the remainder of the gulf as far as
Can&aelig;.</p>

<p>We shall resume our description of each place, lest we
should have omitted any one that is remarkable. And first
with regard to Scepsis.</p>

<p>52. Pal&aelig;scepsis is situated above Cebrene towards the
most elevated part of Ida near Polichna. It had the name of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
Scepsis<a name="FNanchor_1461" id="FNanchor_1461"></a><a href="#Footnote_1461" class="fnanchor">1461</a> either for some other reason or because it was
within view of the places around, if we may be allowed to
derive words then in use among Barbarians from the Greek
language. Afterwards the inhabitants were transferred to
the present Scepsis, 60 stadia lower down, by Scamandrius,
the son of Hector, and by Ascanius, the son of &AElig;neas; these
two families reigned, it is said, a long time at Scepsis. They
changed the form of government to an oligarchy; afterwards
the Milesians united with the Scepsians, and formed a democracy.<a name="FNanchor_1462" id="FNanchor_1462"></a><a href="#Footnote_1462" class="fnanchor">1462</a>
The descendants of these families had nevertheless
the name of kings, and held certain dignities. Antigonus
incorporated the Scepsians with the inhabitants of
Alexandreia (Troas); Lysimachus dissolved this union, and
they returned to their own country.</p>

<p>53. The Scepsian (Demetrius) supposes that Scepsis was
the palace of &AElig;neas, situated between the dominion of &AElig;neas
and Lyrnessus, where, it is said, he took refuge when pursued
by Achilles.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;Remember you not,&#8221; says Achilles, &#8220;how I chased you when alone and
apart from the herds, with swift steps, from the heights of Ida, thence indeed
you escaped to Lyrnessus; but I took and destroyed it.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1463" id="FNanchor_1463"></a><a href="#Footnote_1463" class="fnanchor">1463</a></p>

<p>Present traditions respecting &AElig;neas do not agree with the
story respecting the first founders of Scepsis. For it is said
that he was spared on account of his hatred to Priam:</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;he ever bore hatred to Priam, for never had Priam bestowed any
honour upon him for his valour.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1464" id="FNanchor_1464"></a><a href="#Footnote_1464" class="fnanchor">1464</a></p>

<p>His companion chiefs, the Antenorid&aelig;, and Antenor, and myself,
escaped on account of the hospitality which the latter had
shown to Menelaus.</p>

<p>Sophocles, in his play, The Capture of Troy, says, that a
panther&#8217;s skin was placed before Antenor&#8217;s door as a signal
that his house should be spared from plunder. Antenor and

his four sons, together with the surviving Heneti, are said to
have escaped into Thrace, and thence into Henetica on the Adriatic;<a name="FNanchor_1465" id="FNanchor_1465"></a><a href="#Footnote_1465" class="fnanchor">1465</a>
but &AElig;neas, with his father Anchises and his son Ascanius,
are said to have collected a large body of people, and
to have set sail. Some writers say that he settled about the
Macedonian Olympus; according to others he founded Capu&aelig;,<a name="FNanchor_1466" id="FNanchor_1466"></a><a href="#Footnote_1466" class="fnanchor">1466</a>
near Mantineia in Arcadia, and that he took the name of the
city from Capys. There is another account, that he disembarked
at &AElig;gesta<a name="FNanchor_1467" id="FNanchor_1467"></a><a href="#Footnote_1467" class="fnanchor">1467</a> in Sicily, with Elymus, a Trojan, and
took possession of Eryx<a name="FNanchor_1468" id="FNanchor_1468"></a><a href="#Footnote_1468" class="fnanchor">1468</a> and Lilyb&aelig;us,<a name="FNanchor_1469" id="FNanchor_1469"></a><a href="#Footnote_1469" class="fnanchor">1469</a> and called the rivers
about &AElig;gesta Scamander and Simo&iuml;s; that from Sicily he
went to Latium, and settled there in obedience to an oracle
enjoining him to remain wherever he should eat his table.
This happened in Latium, near Lavinium, when a large cake
of bread which was set down instead of, and for want of, a
table, was eaten together with the meat that was laid upon it.</p>

<p>Homer does not agree either with these writers or with
what is said respecting the founders of Scepsis. For he represents
&AElig;neas as remaining at Troy, succeeding to the kingdom,
and delivering the succession to his children&#8217;s children
after the extinction of the race of Priam:</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;the son of Saturn hated the family of Priam: henceforward &AElig;neas
shall reign over the Trojans, and his children&#8217;s children to late generations.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1470" id="FNanchor_1470"></a><a href="#Footnote_1470" class="fnanchor">1470</a></p>

<p>In this manner not even the succession of Scamandrius
could be maintained. He disagrees still more with those
writers who speak of his wanderings as far as Italy, and
make him end his days in that country. Some write the
verse thus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;The race of &AElig;neas and his children&#8217;s children,&#8221; meaning the Romans,</div>
<div class="line">&#8220;shall rule over all nations.&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>54. The Socratic philosophers, Erastus, Coriscus, and Neleus,
the son of Coriscus, a disciple of Aristotle, and Theophrastus,
were natives of Scepsis. Neleus succeeded to the
possession of the library of Theophrastus, which included that
of Aristotle; for Aristotle gave his library, and left his school,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
to Theophrastus. Aristotle<a name="FNanchor_1471" id="FNanchor_1471"></a><a href="#Footnote_1471" class="fnanchor">1471</a> was the first person with whom
we are acquainted who made a collection of books, and suggested
to the kings of &AElig;gypt the formation of a library.
Theophrastus left his library to Neleus, who carried it to
Scepsis, and bequeathed it to some ignorant persons who kept
the books locked up, lying in disorder. When the Scepsians
understood that the Attalic kings, on whom the city was dependent,
were in eager search for books, with which they intended
to furnish the library at Pergamus, they hid theirs in
an excavation under-ground; at length, but not before they had
been injured by damp and worms, the descendants of Neleus
sold the books of Aristotle and Theophrastus for a large sum
of money to Apellicon of Teos. Apellicon<a name="FNanchor_1472" id="FNanchor_1472"></a><a href="#Footnote_1472" class="fnanchor">1472</a> was rather a
lover of books than a philosopher; when therefore he attempted
to restore the parts which had been eaten and corroded by
worms, he made alterations in the original text and introduced
them into new copies; he moreover supplied the defective parts
unskilfully, and published the books full of errors. It was the
misfortune of the ancient Peripatetics, those after Theophrastus,
that being wholly unprovided with the books of Aristotle,
with the exception of a few only, and those chiefly of
the exoteric<a name="FNanchor_1473" id="FNanchor_1473"></a><a href="#Footnote_1473" class="fnanchor">1473</a> kind, they were unable to philosophize according
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]<br />[CAS. 609]</a></span>
to the principles of the system, and merely occupied themselves
in elaborate discussions on common places. Their successors
however, from the time that these books were published,
philosophized, and propounded the doctrine of Aristotle
more successfully than their predecessors, but were under the
necessity of advancing a great deal as probable only, on account
of the multitude of errors contained in the copies.</p>

<p>Even Rome contributed to this increase of errors; for immediately
on the death of Apellicon, Sylla, who captured
Athens, seized the library of Apellicon. When it was
brought to Rome, Tyrannion,<a name="FNanchor_1474" id="FNanchor_1474"></a><a href="#Footnote_1474" class="fnanchor">1474</a> the grammarian, who was an
admirer of Aristotle, courted the superintendent of the library
and obtained the use of it. Some vendors of books, also,
employed bad scribes and neglected to compare the copies
with the original. This happens in the case of other books
which are copied for sale both here and at Alexandreia.</p>

<p>This may suffice on this subject.</p>

<p>55. Demetrius the grammarian, whom we have frequently
mentioned, was a native of Scepsis. He composed a comment
on the catalogue of the Trojan forces. He was contemporary
with Crates and Aristarchus. He was succeeded
by Metrodorus,<a name="FNanchor_1475" id="FNanchor_1475"></a><a href="#Footnote_1475" class="fnanchor">1475</a> who changed from being a philosopher to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
engage in public affairs. His writings are for the most part
in the style of the rhetoricians. He employed a new and
striking kind of phraseology. Although he was poor, yet, in
consequence of the reputation which he had acquired, he
married a rich wife at Chalcedon, and acquired the surname
of the Chalcedonian. He paid great court to Mithridates
Eupator, whom he accompanied with his wife on a voyage to
Pontus, and received from him distinguished honours. He
was appointed to preside over a tribunal where the party
condemned by the judge had no power of appeal to the king.
His prosperity however was not lasting, for he incurred the
enmity of some very unjust persons, and deserted from the
king at the very time that he was despatched on an embassy
to Tigranes the Armenian. Tigranes sent him back much
against his inclination to Eupator, who was then flying from
his hereditary kingdom. Metrodorus died on the road, either
in consequence of orders from the king, or by natural disease,
for both causes of his death are stated.</p>

<p>So much then respecting Scepsis.</p>

<p>56. Next to Scepsis are Andeira, Pioni&aelig;, and Gargaris.
There is found at Andeira a stone, which when burnt becomes
iron. It is then put into a furnace together with some kind
of earth, when it distils a mock silver, (Pseudargyrum,) or
with the addition of copper it becomes the compound called
oreichalcum. There is found a mock silver near Tmolus
also. These places and those about Assus were occupied by
the Leleges.</p>

<p>57. Assus is a strong place, and well fortified with walls.
There is a long and perpendicular ascent from the sea and
the harbour, so that the verse of Stratonicus the citharist
seems to be applicable to it;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]<br />[CAS. 610]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;Go to Assus, if you mean to reach quickly the confines of death.&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The harbour is formed of a large mole.</p>

<p>Cleanthes, the Stoic philosopher, was a native of this place.
He succeeded to the school of Zeno of Citium, and left it to
Chrysippus of Soli. Here also Aristotle resided for some
time, on account of his relationship to Hermeas the tyrant.
Hermeas was an eunuch, servant of a money-changer. When
he was at Athens he was the hearer both of Plato and of
Aristotle. On his return he became the associate in the
tyranny of his master, who attacked the places near Atarneus
and Assus. He afterwards succeeded his master, sent
for both Aristotle and Xenocrates, and treated them with
kindness. He even gave his niece in marriage to Aristotle.
But Memnon of Rhodes, who was at that time general in the
service of the Persians, invited to his house Hermeas, under
the mask of friendship, and on pretence of business. He
seized Hermeas, and sent him to the king, who ordered him
to be hanged. The philosophers, avoiding places in possession
of the Persians, escaped by flight.</p>

<p>58. Myrsilus says that Assus was founded by Methymn&aelig;ans;
but according to Hellanicus it was an &AElig;olian city, like
Gargara and Lamponia of the &AElig;olians. Gargara<a name="FNanchor_1476" id="FNanchor_1476"></a><a href="#Footnote_1476" class="fnanchor">1476</a> was founded
from Assus; it was not well peopled, for the kings introduced
settlers from Miletopolis,<a name="FNanchor_1477" id="FNanchor_1477"></a><a href="#Footnote_1477" class="fnanchor">1477</a> which they cleared of its inhabitants,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
so that Demetrius the Scepsian says that, instead of
being &AElig;olians, the people became semi-barbarians. In the
time of Homer all these places belonged to Leleges, whom some
writers represent as Carians, but Homer distinguishes them,</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;Near the sea are Carians, and P&aelig;onians with curved bows, Leleges, and
Caucones.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1478" id="FNanchor_1478"></a><a href="#Footnote_1478" class="fnanchor">1478</a></p>

<p>The Leleges were therefore a different people from the Carians,
and lived between the people subject to &AElig;neas and the
Cilicians, as they are called by the poet. After being plundered
by Achilles, they removed to Caria, and occupied the
country about the present Halicarnassus.</p>

<p>59. Pedasus, the city which they abandoned, is no longer
in existence. But in the interior of the country belonging to
the people of Halicarnassus there was a city called by them
Pedasa, and the territory has even now the name of Pedasis.
It is said that this district contained eight cities, occupied by
the Leleges, who were formerly so populous a nation as to
possess Caria as far as Myndus, Bargylia, and a great part of
Pisidia. In later times, when they united with the Carians in
their expeditions, they were dispersed throughout the whole of
Greece, and the race became extinct.</p>

<p>Mausolus, according to Callisthenes, assembled in Halicarnassus<a name="FNanchor_1479" id="FNanchor_1479"></a><a href="#Footnote_1479" class="fnanchor">1479</a>
alone the inhabitants of six out of the eight cities, but
allowed Suangela and Myndus to remain untouched. Herodotus<a name="FNanchor_1480" id="FNanchor_1480"></a><a href="#Footnote_1480" class="fnanchor">1480</a>
relates that whenever anything unfortunate was about to
befall the inhabitants of Pedasus<a name="FNanchor_1481" id="FNanchor_1481"></a><a href="#Footnote_1481" class="fnanchor">1481</a> and the neighbourhood a
beard appeared on the face of the priestess of Minerva, and
that this happened three times.</p>

<p>There is now existing in the territory of the Stratoniceis<a name="FNanchor_1482" id="FNanchor_1482"></a><a href="#Footnote_1482" class="fnanchor">1482</a>
a small town called Pedasum. There are to be seen throughout
the whole of Caria and at Miletus sepulchres, and fortifications,
and vestiges of settlements of the Leleges.</p>

<p>60. The tract of sea-coast following next after the Leleges
was occupied, according to Homer, by Cilicians, but at present
it is occupied by Adramytteni, Atarneit&aelig;, and Pitan&aelig;i as far
as the mouth of the Ca&iuml;cus. The Cilicians were divided into
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]<br />[CAS. 611]</a></span>
two dynasties, as we have before said,<a name="FNanchor_1483" id="FNanchor_1483"></a><a href="#Footnote_1483" class="fnanchor">1483</a> the head of one was
Eetion, the other Mynes.</p>

<p>61. Homer says that Thebe was the city of Eetion;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;We went to Thebe, the sacred city of Eetion.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1484" id="FNanchor_1484"></a><a href="#Footnote_1484" class="fnanchor">1484</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>To him also belonged Chrysa, which contained the temple
of Apollo Smintheus, for Chryse&iuml;s was taken from Thebe;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;We went,&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>he says,</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;to Thebe, ravaged it, and carried everything away; the sons of the
Ach&aelig;ans divided the booty among themselves, but selected for Atrides the
beautiful Chryse&iuml;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lyrnessus he calls the city of Mynes, for</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;having plundered Lyrnessus, and destroyed the walls of Thebe,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1485" id="FNanchor_1485"></a><a href="#Footnote_1485" class="fnanchor">1485</a></p>

<p>Achilles slew Mynes and Epistrophus, so that when Bryse&iuml;s
says,</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;you suffered me not to weep when the swift Achilles slew my husband,
and laid waste the city of the divine Mynes,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1486" id="FNanchor_1486"></a><a href="#Footnote_1486" class="fnanchor">1486</a></p>

<p>the poet cannot mean Thebe, for that belonged to Eetion, but
Lyrnessus, for both cities lay in what was afterwards called
the plain of Thebe, which, on account of its fertility, was a
subject of contest among the Mysians and Lydians formerly,
and latterly among the Greeks who had migrated from &AElig;olis
and Lesbos. At present Adramytteni possess the greater
part of it; there are Thebe and Lyrnessus, a strong place,
but both are deserted. One is situated at the distance of 60
stadia from Adramyttium on one side, and the other 88 stadia
on the other side.</p>

<p>62. In the Adramyttene district are Chrysa and Cilla.
There is at present near Thebe a place called Cilla, in which
is a temple of Apollo Cill&aelig;us. Beside it runs a river, which
comes from Mount Ida. These places are near Antandria.
The Cill&aelig;um in Lesbos has its name from this Cilla. There
is also a mountain Cill&aelig;um between Gargara and Antandrus.
Daes of Colon&aelig; says that the temple of Apollo Cill&aelig;us was
founded at Colon&aelig; by the &AElig;olians, who came by sea from
Greece. At Chrysa also it is said that there is a Cill&aelig;an
Apollo, but it is uncertain whether it is the same as Apollo
Smintheus, or a different statue.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span></p>

<p>63. Chrysa is a small town on the sea-coast with a harbour.
Near and above it is Thebe. Here was the temple of
Apollo Smintheus, and here Chryse&iuml;s lived. The place at present
is entirely abandoned. To the present Chrysa, near Hamaxitus,
was transferred the temple of the Cilicians, one party
of whom went to Pamphylia, the other to Hamaxitus. Those
who are not well acquainted with ancient histories say that
Chryses and Chryse&iuml;s lived there, and that Homer mentions
the place. But there is no harbour at this place, yet Homer
says,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;but when they entered the deep harbour,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1487" id="FNanchor_1487"></a><a href="#Footnote_1487" class="fnanchor">1487</a>&mdash;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>nor is the temple on the sea-coast, but Homer places it there;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;Chryse&iuml;s left the ship; then the sage Ulysses, leading her to the altar,
placed her in the hands of her beloved father.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1488" id="FNanchor_1488"></a><a href="#Footnote_1488" class="fnanchor">1488</a></p>

<p>Nor is it near Thebe, but it is near it, according to Homer, for
he says, that Chryse&iuml;s was taken away from thence.</p>

<p>Nor is there any place of the name of Cilla in the district
of the Alexandreia, (Troas,) nor a temple of Apollo Cill&aelig;us,
whereas the poet joins them together:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;who art the guardian of Chrysa, and the divine Cilla.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1489" id="FNanchor_1489"></a><a href="#Footnote_1489" class="fnanchor">1489</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But it is in the plain of Thebe that they are seen near together.
The voyage from the Cilician Chrysa to the Naustathmus
(or naval station) is about 700 stadia, and occupies a
day, which is as much as Ulysses seems to have completed;
for immediately upon leaving the vessel he offers sacrifice to
the god, and being overtaken by the evening, remains there.
In the morning he sets sail. It is scarcely a third of the
above-mentioned distance from Hamaxitus, so that Ulysses
could have performed his sacrifice and have returned to the
Naustathmus the same day. There is also a monument of
Cillus, a large mound, near the temple of Apollo Cill&aelig;us.
He is said to have been the charioteer of Pelops, and to
have had the chief command in these parts. Perhaps the
country Cilicia had its name from him, or he had his from the
country.</p>

<p>64. The story about the Teucri, and the mice from whom
the name of Smintheus is derived, (for mice are called Sminthii,)
must be transferred to this place.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]<br />[CAS. 613]</a></span></p>

<p>They excuse the derivation of titles from insignificant objects
by examples of this kind; as from the parnopes, which
the &#338;t&aelig;ans call cornopes, Hercules had a surname, and was
worshipped under the title of Hercules Cornopion, because he
had delivered them from locusts. So the Erythr&aelig;ans, who
live near the river Melius, worship Hercules Ipoctonus, because
he destroyed the ipes, or worms, which are destructive
to vines; for this pest is found everywhere except in the
country of the Erythr&aelig;ans. The Rhodians have in the island
a temple of Apollo Erythibius, so called from erysibe, (mildew,)
and which they call erythibe. Among the &AElig;olians in Asia
one of their months is called Pornopion, for this name the
B&#339;otians give to parnopes, (locusts,) and a sacrifice is performed
to Apollo Pornopion.</p>

<p>65. The country about Adramyttium is Mysia. It was
once subject to Lydians, and there are now Pyl&aelig; Lydi&aelig; (or
the Lydian Gates) at Adramyttium, the city having been
founded, it is said, by Lydians.</p>

<p>Astyra also, the village near Adramyttium, is said to belong
to Mysia. It was once a small city, in which was the
temple of Artemis Astyrene, situated in a grove. The Antandrians,
in whose neighbourhood it is more immediately
situated, preside over it with great solemnity. It is distant
20 stadia from the ancient Chrysa, which also has a temple in
a grove. There too is the Rampart of Achilles. At the distance
of 50 stadia in the interior is Thebe, uninhabited, which
the poet says was situated below the woody Placus. But
there is neither Placus nor Plax there, nor a wood above it,
although near Ida.</p>

<p>Thebe is distant from Astyra 70, and from Andeira 60
stadia. All these are names of uninhabited places, or thinly
inhabited, or of rivers which are torrents. But they owe
their fame to ancient history.</p>

<p>66. Assus and Adramyttium are considerable cities. Adramyttium
was unfortunate in the Mithridatic war, for Diodorus
the general, in order to gratify the king, put to death the
council of the citizens, although at the same time he pretended
to be a philosopher of the Academy, pleaded causes, and professed
to teach rhetoric. He accompanied the king on his
voyage to Pontus, but upon his overthrow Diodorus was
punished for his crimes. Many accusations were simultaneously
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
preferred against him: but, unable to endure the disgrace,
he basely destroyed himself in my native city by abstaining
from food.</p>

<p>Adramyttium produced Xenocles, a distinguished orator,
who adopted the Asiatic style of eloquence and was remarkable
for the vehemence of his manner; he defended Asia before
the senate, at the time when that province was accused of
favouring the party of Mithridates.</p>

<p>67. Near Astyra is a lake called Sapra, full of deep holes,
that empties itself by a ravine among ridges of rocks on the
coast. Below Andeira is a temple dedicated to the Andeirenian
mother of the gods, and a cave with a subterraneous passage
extending to Pal&aelig;a. Pal&aelig;a is a settlement distant 130 stadia
from Andeira. A goat, which fell into the opening, discovered
the subterraneous passage. It was found at Andeira
the next day, accidentally, by the shepherd, who had gone
there to a sacrifice.</p>

<p>Atarneus<a name="FNanchor_1490" id="FNanchor_1490"></a><a href="#Footnote_1490" class="fnanchor">1490</a> is the royal seat of Hermeas the tyrant. Next is
Pitane, an &AElig;olian city, with two harbours, and the river
Euenus flowing beside it, which supplies the aqueduct of
the Adramyttium with water.</p>

<p>Arcesilaus of the Academy was a native of Pitane, and a
fellow-disciple of Zeno of Citium in the school of Polemo.</p>

<p>There is a place in Pitane called &#8220;Atarneus under Pitane,&#8221;
opposite to the island called El&aelig;ussa.</p>

<p>It is said that at Pitane bricks float upon the water, as was
the case with a small island<a name="FNanchor_1491" id="FNanchor_1491"></a><a href="#Footnote_1491" class="fnanchor">1491</a> in Tyrrhenia, for the earth,
being lighter than an equal bulk of water, swims upon it.
Poseidonius says, that he saw in Spain bricks made of an argillaceous
earth (with which silver vessels are cleansed) floating
upon water.</p>

<p>After Pitane the Ca&iuml;cus<a name="FNanchor_1492" id="FNanchor_1492"></a><a href="#Footnote_1492" class="fnanchor">1492</a> empties itself, at the distance of 30
stadia from it, into the Ela&iuml;tic bay. Beyond the Ca&iuml;cus, at
the distance of 12 stadia from the river, is El&aelig;a, an &AElig;olian
city; it is the arsenal of Pergamum, and distant from it
120 stadia.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]<br />[CAS. 615]</a></span></p>

<p>68. At 100 stadia farther is Cane, the promontory opposite
to Lectum, and forming the gulf of Adramyttium, of
which the Ela&iuml;tic Gulf is a part. Can&aelig; is a small city of the
Locrians who came from Cynus; it is situated in the Can&aelig;an
territory, opposite the most southerly extremities of Lesbos.
This territory extends to the Arginus&aelig;, and the promontory
above, which some call Aiga, or the goat. The second syllable
however must be pronounced long, Aigan, like Actan
and Archan, for this was the name of the whole mountain,
which at present is called Cane, or Can&aelig;.<a name="FNanchor_1493" id="FNanchor_1493"></a><a href="#Footnote_1493" class="fnanchor">1493</a> The sea surrounds
the mountain on the south and west; towards the
east the plain of Ca&iuml;cus lies below, and on the north the
Ela&iuml;tic district. The mountain itself is very much contracted.
It inclines indeed towards the &AElig;g&aelig;an Sea, from which it has
the name (&AElig;ga), but afterwards the promontory itself was
called &AElig;ga, the name which Sappho gives it, and then Cane
and Can&aelig;.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span></p>

<p>69. Between El&aelig;a, Pitane, Atarneus, and Pergamum on
this side the Ca&iuml;cus, is Teuthrania, distant from none of
these places above 70 stadia. Teuthras is said to have been
king of the Cilicians and Mysians. According to Euripides,
Auge, with her son Telephus, was enclosed in a chest and
thrown into the sea, by command of her father Aleus, who
discovered that she had been violated by Hercules. By the
care of Minerva the chest crossed the sea, and was cast ashore
at the mouth of the Ca&iuml;cus. Teuthras took up the mother
and her son, married the former, and treated the latter as his
own child. This is a fable, but another concurrence of circumstances
is wanting to explain how the daughter of the
Arcadian became the wife of the king of the Mysians, and
how her son succeeded to the throne of the Mysians. It is
however believed that Teuthras and Telephus governed the
country lying about Teuthrania and the Ca&iuml;cus, but the
poet mentions a few particulars only of this history:</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;as when he slew the son of Telephus, the hero Eurypylus, and many of
his companions, the Cet&aelig;i, were killed around him for the sake of the
gifts of women.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1494" id="FNanchor_1494"></a><a href="#Footnote_1494" class="fnanchor">1494</a></p>

<p>Homer here rather proposes an enigma than a clear meaning.
For we do not know who the Cet&aelig;i were, nor what people
we are to understand by this name, nor what is meant by
the words, &#8220;for the sake of the gifts of women.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1495" id="FNanchor_1495"></a><a href="#Footnote_1495" class="fnanchor">1495</a> Grammarians
adduce and compare with this other stories, but they
indulge in invention rather than solve the difficulty.</p>

<p>70. Let us dismiss this doubtful matter, and turn to what
is more certain; for instance, according to Homer, Eurypylus
appears to have been king of the places about the Ca&iuml;cus, so
that perhaps a part of the Cilicians were his subjects, and
that there were not only two but three dynasties among that
people.</p>

<p>This opinion is supported by the circumstance that in the
Ela&iuml;tis there is a small river, like a winter torrent, of the
name of Ceteium. This falls into another like it, then again
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]<br />[CAS. 616]</a></span>
into another, but all discharge themselves into the Ca&iuml;cus.
The Ca&iuml;cus does not flow from Ida, as Bacchylides says, nor
does Euripides say correctly that Marsyas</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;inhabited the famous Cel&aelig;n&aelig;, at the extremity of Ida,&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>for Cel&aelig;n&aelig; is at a great distance from Ida, and so are the
sources of the Ca&iuml;cus, for they are to be seen in the plain.</p>

<p>There is a mountain, Temnum, which separates this and
the plain of Asia; it lies in the interior above the plain of
Thebe. A river, Mysius, flows from Temnum and enters
the Ca&iuml;cus below its source. Hence some persons suppose
that &AElig;schylus refers to it in the beginning of the prologue
to the play of the Myrmidons,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;Ca&iuml;cus, and ye Mysian streams&#8221;&mdash;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Near its source is a village called Gergitha, to which Attalus
transferred the inhabitants of Gergitha in the Troad, after
destroying their own town.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Since</span> Lesbos, a very remarkable island, lies along and
opposite to the sea-coast, extending from Lectum to Can&aelig;,
and since it is surrounded by small islands, some of which lie
beyond it, others in the space between Lesbos and the continent,
it is now proper to describe them, because they are
&AElig;olian places, and Lesbos is, as it were, the capital of the
&AElig;olian cities. We shall begin where we set out to describe
the coast opposite to the island.</p>

<p>2. In sailing from Lectum to Assus the Lesbian district
begins opposite to Sigrium,<a name="FNanchor_1496" id="FNanchor_1496"></a><a href="#Footnote_1496" class="fnanchor">1496</a> its northern promontory. Somewhere
there is Methymna,<a name="FNanchor_1497" id="FNanchor_1497"></a><a href="#Footnote_1497" class="fnanchor">1497</a> a city of the Lesbians, 60 stadia
from the coast, between Polymedium and Assus. The whole
island is 1100 stadia in circumference. The particulars are
these.</p>

<p>From Methymna to Malia,<a name="FNanchor_1498" id="FNanchor_1498"></a><a href="#Footnote_1498" class="fnanchor">1498</a> the most southern promontory
to those who have the island on their right hand, and to
which Can&aelig;<a name="FNanchor_1499" id="FNanchor_1499"></a><a href="#Footnote_1499" class="fnanchor">1499</a> lies directly opposite, are 340 stadia. Thence
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
to Sigrium, which is the length of the island, 560 stadia,
thence to Methymna 210 stadia.<a name="FNanchor_1500" id="FNanchor_1500"></a><a href="#Footnote_1500" class="fnanchor">1500</a></p>

<p>Mitylene, the largest city, lies between Methymna and
Malia, at the distance from Malia of 70 stadia, and from Can&aelig;
of 120, and as many from the Arginuss&aelig; islands,<a name="FNanchor_1501" id="FNanchor_1501"></a><a href="#Footnote_1501" class="fnanchor">1501</a> which are
three small islands near the continent, and situated near
Can&aelig;. In the interval between Mitylene and Methymna, at
a village called &AElig;geirus in the Methymn&aelig;an territory, is the
narrowest part of the island, having a passage of 20 stadia to
the Pyrrh&aelig;an Euripus.<a name="FNanchor_1502" id="FNanchor_1502"></a><a href="#Footnote_1502" class="fnanchor">1502</a> Pyrrha<a name="FNanchor_1503" id="FNanchor_1503"></a><a href="#Footnote_1503" class="fnanchor">1503</a> is situated on the western
side of Lesbos, at the distance of 100 stadia from Malia.</p>

<p>Mitylene has two harbours; of which the southern is a
closed harbour for triremes, and capable of holding 50 vessels.
The northern harbour is large, and deep, and protected by a
mole. In front of both lies a small island, which contains a
part of the city. Mitylene is well provided with everything.</p>

<p>3. It formerly produced celebrated men, as Pittacus, one of
the Seven Wise Men; Alc&aelig;us the poet, and his brother Antimenidas,
who, according to Alc&aelig;us, when fighting on the side
of the Babylonians, achieved a great exploit, and extricated
them from their danger by killing</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;a valiant warrior, the king&#8217;s wrestler, who was four cubits in height.&#8221;</p>

<p>Contemporary with these persons flourished Sappho, an extraordinary
woman; for at no period within memory has any
woman been known at all to be compared to her in poetry.</p>

<p>At this period Mitylene was ruled by many tyrants, in consequence
of the dissensions among the citizens. These dissensions
are the subject of the poems of Alc&aelig;us called Stasiotica
(the Seditions). One of these tyrants was Pittacus:
Alc&aelig;us inveighed against him as well as against Myrsilus,
Megalagyrus<a name="FNanchor_1504" id="FNanchor_1504"></a><a href="#Footnote_1504" class="fnanchor">1504</a> the Cleanactid&aelig;, and some others; nor was he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]<br />[CAS. 617]</a></span>
himself clear from the imputation of favouring these political
changes. Pittacus himself employed monarchical power to
dissolve the despotism of the many, but, having done this, he
restored the independence of the city.</p>

<p>At a late period afterwards appeared Diophanes the rhetorician;
in our times Potamo, Lesbocles, Crinagoras, and
Theophanes the historian.<a name="FNanchor_1505" id="FNanchor_1505"></a><a href="#Footnote_1505" class="fnanchor">1505</a> The latter was versed in political
affairs, and became the friend of Pompey the Great, chiefly
on account of his accomplishments and assistance he afforded
in directing to a successful issue all his enterprises. Hence,
partly by means of Pompey, partly by his own exertions, he
became an ornament to his country, and rendered himself the
most illustrious of all the Grecians. He left a son, Mark
Pompey, whom Augustus C&aelig;sar appointed prefect of Asia,
and who is now reckoned among the number of the chief
friends of Tiberius.</p>

<p>The Athenians were in danger of incurring irremediable
disgrace by passing a decree that all the Mitylen&aelig;ans who
had attained the age of puberty should be put to death. They,
however, recalled their resolution, and the counter-decree
reached their generals only one day before the former order
was to be executed.</p>

<p>4. Pyrrha is in ruins. But the suburb is inhabited, and
has a port, whence to Mitylene is a passage of 80 stadia. Next
after Pyrrha is Eressus.<a name="FNanchor_1506" id="FNanchor_1506"></a><a href="#Footnote_1506" class="fnanchor">1506</a> It is situated upon a hill, and extends
to the sea. Thence to Sigrium 28 stadia.</p>

<p>Eressus was the birth-place of Theophrastus, and of Phanias,
Peripatetic philosophers, disciples of Aristotle. Theophrastus
was called Tyrtamus before his name was changed by
Aristotle to Theophrastus, thus getting rid of the cacophony
of the former name, and at the same time expressing the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
beauty of his elocution, for Aristotle made all his disciples
eloquent, but Theophrastus the most eloquent of them all.</p>

<p>Antissa<a name="FNanchor_1507" id="FNanchor_1507"></a><a href="#Footnote_1507" class="fnanchor">1507</a> is next to Sigrium. It is a city with a harbour.
Then follows Methymna, of which place Arion was a native,
who, as Herodotus relates the story, after having been thrown
into the sea by pirates, escaped safe to T&aelig;narus on the back of
a dolphin. He played on the cithara and sang to it. Terpander,
who practised the same kind of music, was a native of
this island. He was the first person that used the lyre with
seven instead of four strings, as is mentioned in the verses attributed
to him:</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;we have relinquished the song adapted to four strings, and shall cause
new hymns to resound on a seven-stringed cithara.&#8221;</p>

<p>The historian Hellanicus, and Callias, who has commented
on Sappho and Alc&aelig;us, were Lesbians.</p>

<p>5. Near the strait situated between Asia and Lesbos there
are about twenty small islands, or, according to Timosthenes,
forty. They are called Hecatonnesoi,<a name="FNanchor_1508" id="FNanchor_1508"></a><a href="#Footnote_1508" class="fnanchor">1508</a> a compound name like
Peloponnesus, the letter N being repeated by custom in such
words as Myonnesus, Proconnesus, Halonnesus, so that Hecatonnesoi
is of the same import as Apollonnesoi, since Apollo
is called Hecatus;<a name="FNanchor_1509" id="FNanchor_1509"></a><a href="#Footnote_1509" class="fnanchor">1509</a> for along the whole of this coast, as far as
Tenedos, Apollo is held in the highest veneration, and worshipped
under the names of Smintheus, Cill&aelig;us, Gryneus, or
other appellations.</p>

<p>Near these islands is Pordoselene, which contains a city of
the same name, and in front of this city is another island<a name="FNanchor_1510" id="FNanchor_1510"></a><a href="#Footnote_1510" class="fnanchor">1510</a>
larger than this, and a city of the same name, uninhabited, in
which there is a temple of Apollo.</p>

<p>6. Some persons, in order to avoid the indecorum couched
in these names,<a name="FNanchor_1511" id="FNanchor_1511"></a><a href="#Footnote_1511" class="fnanchor">1511</a> say that we ought to read in that place Poroselene,
and to call Aspordenum, the rocky and barren mountain
near Pergamum, Asporenum, and the temple there of the
mother of the gods the temple of the Asporene mother of the
gods; what then are we to say to the names Pordalis, Saperdes,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]<br />[CAS. 619]</a></span>
Perdiccas, and to this word in the verse of Simonides,
&#8220;with clothes dripping with wet,&#8221; (&#960;&#959;&#961;&#948;&#8049;&#954;&#959;&#953;&#963;&#953;&#957; for &#948;&#953;&#945;&#946;&#961;&#8057;&#967;&#959;&#953;&#962;,)
and in the old comedy somewhere, &#8220;the country is &#960;&#959;&#961;&#948;&#945;&#954;&#8057;&#957;,
for &#955;&#953;&#956;&#957;&#8049;&#950;&#959;&#957;, or &#8216;marshy.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Lesbos is at the same distance, rather less than 500 stadia,
from Tenedos, Lemnos, and Chios.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Since</span> there subsisted so great an affinity among the
Leleges and Cilicians with the Trojans, the reason is asked,
why these people are not included in Homer&#8217;s Catalogue. Perhaps
it is that, on account of the loss of their leaders and the
devastation of the cities, the few Cilicians that were left
placed themselves under the command of Hector. For Eetion
and his sons are said to have been killed before the Catalogue
is mentioned;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;I had seven brothers in the palace; all of them went in one day to

<p>And in another place,</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;he killed Satnius with a spear&mdash;the son of Enops, whom a beautiful
nymph Neis bore to Enops, when he was tending herds near the banks of
Satnioeis,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1515" id="FNanchor_1515"></a><a href="#Footnote_1515" class="fnanchor">1515</a></p>

<p>for they had not been so completely annihilated as to prevent

</div></div></div>

<p>nor was the city entirely razed, for he adds,</p>

&#8220;who commanded the lofty city Pedasus.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1517" id="FNanchor_1517"></a><a href="#Footnote_1517" class="fnanchor">1517</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>He has passed them over in the Catalogue, not considering
the body of people large enough to have a place in it; or he
comprised them among the people under the command of
Hector, as being allied to one another. For Lycaon, the
brother of Hector, says,</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;my mother Laotho&euml;, daughter of the old Altes, brought me into the
world to live but a short time; of Altes, king of the war-loving Leleges.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1518" id="FNanchor_1518"></a><a href="#Footnote_1518" class="fnanchor">1518</a></p>

<p>Such is the reasoning, from probability, which this subject
admits.</p>

<p>2. We reason from probability when we endeavour to determine
by the words of the poet the exact bounds of the
territory of the Cilicians, Pelasgi, and of the people situated
between them, namely, the Ceteii, who were under the command
of Eurypylus.</p>

<p>We have said of the Cilicians and of the people under the
command of Eurypylus what can be said about them, and that
they are bounded by the country near the Ca&iuml;cus.</p>

<p>It is agreeable to probability to place the Pelasgi next to
these people, according to the words of Homer and other histories.
Homer says,</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;Hippothous led the tribes of the Pelasgi, who throw the spear, who inhabited
the fertile Larisa; their leaders were Hippothous and Pyl&aelig;us, a
son of Mars, both sons of Lethus the Pelasgian, son of Teutamis.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1519" id="FNanchor_1519"></a><a href="#Footnote_1519" class="fnanchor">1519</a></p>

<p>He here represents the numbers of Pelasgi as considerable,
for he does not speak of them as a tribe, but &#8220;tribes,&#8221; and
specifies the place of their settlement, Larisa. There are
many places of the name of Larisa, but we must understand
some one of those near the Troad, and perhaps we might not
be wrong in supposing it to be that near Cyme; for of three
places of the name of Larisa, that near Hamaxitus is quite in
sight of Ilium and very near it, at the distance of about 200
stadia, so that Hippothous could not be said consistently with
probability to fall, in the contest about Patroclus,</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]<br />[CAS. 620]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;far from Larisa,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1520" id="FNanchor_1520"></a><a href="#Footnote_1520" class="fnanchor">1520</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>at least from this Larisa, but rather from the Larisa near
Cyme, for there are about 1000 stadia between them. The
third Larisa is a village in the Ephesian district in the plain
of the Ca&yuml;ster; which, it is said, was formerly a city containing
a temple of Apollo Laris&aelig;us, and situated nearer to
Mount Tmolus than to Ephesus. It is distant from Ephesus
180 stadia, so that it might be placed rather under the government
of the M&aelig;onians. The Ephesians, having afterwards
acquired more power, deprived the M&aelig;onians, whom we now
call Lydians, of a large part of their territory; but not even
this, but the other rather, would be the Larisa of the Pelasgi.
For we have no strong evidence that the Larisa in the plain
of Ca&yuml;ster was in existence at that time, nor even of the existence
of Ephesus. But all the &AElig;olian history, relating to a
period a little subsequent to the Trojan times, proves the existence
of the Larisa near Cyme.</p>

<p>3. It is said that the people who set out from Phricium, a
Locrian mountain above Thermopyl&aelig;, settled on the spot
where Cyme is now situated; and finding the Pelasgi, who
had been great sufferers in the Trojan war, yet still in possession
of Larisa, distant about 70 stadia from Cyme, erected as a
defence against them what is at present called Neon-teichos,
(or the New Wall,) 30 stadia from Larisa. They took Larisa,<a name="FNanchor_1521" id="FNanchor_1521"></a><a href="#Footnote_1521" class="fnanchor">1521</a>
founded Cyme, and transferred to it as settlers the surviving
Pelasgi. Cyme is called Cyme Phriconis from the Locrian
mountain, and Larisa also (Phriconis): it is now deserted.</p>

<p>That the Pelasgi were a great nation history, it is said,
furnishes other evidence. For Menecrates of El&aelig;a, in his
work on the foundation of cities, says, that the whole of the
present Ionian coast, beginning from Mycale and the neighbouring
islands, were formerly inhabited by Pelasgi. But
the Lesbians say, that they were commanded by Pyl&aelig;us, who
is called by the poet the chief of the Pelasgi, and that it was
from him that the mountain in their country had the name of
Pyl&aelig;um.</p>

<p>The Chians also say, that the Pelasgi from Thessaly were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
their founders. The Pelasgi, however, were a nation disposed
to wander, ready to remove from settlement to settlement, and
experienced both a great increase and a sudden diminution of
strength and numbers, particularly at the time of the &AElig;olian
and Ionian migrations to Asia.</p>

<p>4. Something peculiar took place among the Laris&aelig;ans in
the plain of Ca&yuml;ster, in the Phriconis, and in Thessaly. All
of them occupied a country, the soil of which has been accumulated
by rivers, by the Ca&yuml;ster,<a name="FNanchor_1522" id="FNanchor_1522"></a><a href="#Footnote_1522" class="fnanchor">1522</a> the Hermus,<a name="FNanchor_1523" id="FNanchor_1523"></a><a href="#Footnote_1523" class="fnanchor">1523</a> and the
Peneus.<a name="FNanchor_1524" id="FNanchor_1524"></a><a href="#Footnote_1524" class="fnanchor">1524</a></p>

<p>At Larisa Phriconis Piasus is said to receive great honours.
He was chief of the Pelasgi, and enamoured, it is
said, of his daughter Larisa, whom he violated, and was punished
for the outrage. She discovered him leaning over a
cask of wine, seized him by his legs, lifted him up, and dropped
him down into the vessel. These are ancient accounts.</p>

<p>5. To the present &AElig;olian cities we must add &AElig;g&aelig; and
Temnus, the birth-place of Hermagoras, who wrote a book on
the Art of Rhetoric.</p>

<p>These cities are on the mountainous country which is above
the district of Cyme, and that of the Phoc&aelig;ans and Smyrn&aelig;ans,
beside which flows the Hermus.</p>

<p>Not far from these cities is Magnesia under Sipylus, made
a free city by a decree of the Romans. The late earthquakes
have injured this place. To the opposite parts, which incline
towards the Ca&iuml;cus to Cyme from Larisa, in passing to which
the river Hermus is crossed, are 70 stadia; thence to Myrina
40 stadia; thence to Grynium 40 stadia, and thence to El&aelig;a.
But, according to Artemidorus, next to Cyme is Ad&aelig;; then,
at the distance of 40 stadia, a promontory, which they call
Hydra, that forms the Ela&iuml;tic Gulf with the opposite promontory
Harmatus. The breadth of the entrance is about 80
stadia, including the winding of the bays. Myrina, situated at
60 stadia, is an &AElig;olian city with a harbour, then the harbour
of Ach&aelig;ans, where are altars of the twelve gods; next is
Grynium, a small city [of the Myrin&aelig;ans], a temple of Apollo,
an ancient oracle, and a costly fane of white marble. To
Myrina are 40 stadia; then 70 stadia to El&aelig;a, which has a
harbour and a station for vessels of the Attalic kings, founded
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]<br />[CAS. 622]</a></span>
by Menestheus and the Athenians who accompanied him in
the expedition against Ilium.</p>

<p>The places about Pitane, and Atarneus, and others in this
quarter, which follow El&aelig;a, have been already described.</p>

<p>6. Cyme is the largest and best of the &AElig;olian cities.
This and Lesbos may be considered the capitals of the other
cities, about 30 in number, of which not a few exist no longer.
The inhabitants of Cyme are ridiculed for their stupidity, for,
according to some writers, it is said of them that they only
began to let the tolls of the harbour three hundred years after
the foundation of their city, and that before this time the town
had never received any revenue of the kind; hence the report
that it was late before they perceived that they inhabited a
city lying on the sea.</p>

<p>There is another story, that, having borrowed money in the
name of the state, they pledged their porticos as security for
the payment of it. Afterwards, the money not having been
repaid on the appointed day, they were prohibited from walking
in them. The creditors, through shame, gave notice by
the crier whenever it rained, that the inhabitants might take
shelter under the porticos. As the crier called out, &#8220;Go
under the porticos,&#8221; a report prevailed that the Cym&aelig;ans did
not perceive that they were to go under the porticos when it
rained unless they had notice from the public crier.<a name="FNanchor_1525" id="FNanchor_1525"></a><a href="#Footnote_1525" class="fnanchor">1525</a></p>

<p>Ephorus, a man indisputably of high repute, a disciple of
Isocrates the orator, was a native of this city. He was an
historian, and wrote the book on Inventions.</p>

<p>Hesiod the poet, who long preceded Ephorus, was a native
of this place, for he himself says, that his father Dius left
Cyme in &AElig;olis and migrated to the B&#339;otians;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;he dwelt near Helicon in Ascra, a village wretched in winter, in summer
oppressive, and not pleasant at any season.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span></p>

<p>It is not generally admitted that Homer was from Cyme, for
many dispute about him.</p>

<p>The name of the city was derived from an Amazon, as that
of Myrina was the name of an Amazon, buried under the
Batieia in the plain of Troy;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;men call this Batieia; but the immortals, the tomb of the bounding
Myrina.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1526" id="FNanchor_1526"></a><a href="#Footnote_1526" class="fnanchor">1526</a></p>

<p>Ephorus is bantered, because, having no achievements of
his countrymen to commemorate among the other exploits in
his history, and yet being unwilling to pass them over unnoticed,
he exclaims,</p>

&#8220;at this time the Cym&aelig;ans were at peace.&#8221;</div>

<p>After having described the Trojan and &AElig;olian coasts, we
ought next to notice cursorily the interior of the country as
far as Mount Taurus, observing the same order.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Pergamum</span><a name="FNanchor_1527" id="FNanchor_1527"></a><a href="#Footnote_1527" class="fnanchor">1527</a> has a kind of supremacy among these places.
It is a city of note, and flourished during a long period under
the Attalic kings; and here we shall begin our description,
premising a short account of her kings, their origin, and the
end of their career.</p>

<p>Pergamum was the treasure-hold of Lysimachus, the son
of Agathocles, and one of the successors of Alexander. It is
situated on the very summit of the mountain which terminates
in a sharp peak like a pine-cone. Philet&aelig;rus of Tyana
was intrusted with the custody of this stronghold, and of the
treasure, which amounted to nine thousand talents. He
became an eunuch in childhood by compression, for it happened
that a great body of people being assembled to see a
funeral, the nurse who was carrying Philet&aelig;rus, then an infant,
in her arms, was entangled in the crowd, and pressed
upon to such a degree that the child was mutilated.</p>

<p>He was therefore an eunuch, but having been well educated
he was thought worthy of this trust. He continued for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]<br />[CAS. 623]</a></span>
some time well affected to Lysimachus, but upon a disagreement
with Arsino&euml;, the wife of Lysimachus, who had falsely
accused him, he caused the place to revolt, and suited his
political conduct to the times, perceiving them to be favourable
to change. Lysimachus, overwhelmed with domestic
troubles, was compelled to put to death Agathocles his son.
Seleucus Nicator invaded his country and destroyed his
power, but was himself treacherously slain by Ptolemy
Ceraunus.</p>

<p>During these disorders the eunuch remained in the fortress,
continually employing the policy of promises and other courtesies
with those who were the strongest and the nearest to
himself. He thus continued master of the stronghold for
twenty years.</p>

<p>2. He had two brothers, the elder of whom was Eumenes,
the younger Attalus. Eumenes had a son of the same name,
who succeeded to the possession of Pergamum, and was then
sovereign of the places around, so that he overcame in a battle
near Sardes<a name="FNanchor_1528" id="FNanchor_1528"></a><a href="#Footnote_1528" class="fnanchor">1528</a> Antiochus, the son of Seleucus, and died
after a reign of two-and-twenty years.</p>

<p>Attalus, the son of Attalus and Antiochis, daughter of
Ach&aelig;us, succeeded to the kingdom. He was the first person
who was proclaimed king after a victory, which he obtained
in a great battle with the Galatians. He became an ally of
the Romans, and, in conjunction with the Rhodian fleet,
assisted them in the war against Philip. He died in old age,
having reigned forty-three years. He left four sons by
Apollonis, a woman of Cyzicus,&mdash;Eumenes, Attalus, Philet&aelig;rus,
and Athen&aelig;us. The younger sons continued in a private
station, but Eumenes, the elder, was king. He was an ally
of the Romans in the war with Antiochus the Great, and with
Perseus; he received from the Romans all the country within
the Taurus which had belonged to Antiochus. Before this
time there were not under the power of Pergamum many
places which reached the sea at the Ela&iuml;tic and the Adramyttene
Gulfs. Eumenes embellished the city, he ornamented
the Nicephorium<a name="FNanchor_1529" id="FNanchor_1529"></a><a href="#Footnote_1529" class="fnanchor">1529</a> with a grove, enriched it with votive offerings
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
and a library, and by his care raised the city of Pergamum
to its present magnificence. After he had reigned
forty-nine years he left the kingdom to Attalus, his son by
Stratonice, daughter of Ariarathus, king of Cappadocia.</p>

<p>He appointed as guardian of his son, who was very young,<a name="FNanchor_1530" id="FNanchor_1530"></a><a href="#Footnote_1530" class="fnanchor">1530</a>
and as regent of the kingdom, his brother Attalus, who died
an old man after a reign of twenty years, having performed
many glorious actions. He assisted Demetrius, the son of
Seleucus, in the war against Alexander, the son of Antiochus,
and was the ally of the Romans in the war against the
Pseudo-Philip. In an expedition into Thrace he defeated
and took prisoner Diegylis, king of the C&aelig;ni.<a name="FNanchor_1531" id="FNanchor_1531"></a><a href="#Footnote_1531" class="fnanchor">1531</a> He destroyed
Prusias by exciting his son Nicomedes to rebel against his
father. He left the kingdom to Attalus his ward. His
cognomen was Philometor. He reigned five years, and died
a natural death. He left the Romans his heirs.<a name="FNanchor_1532" id="FNanchor_1532"></a><a href="#Footnote_1532" class="fnanchor">1532</a> They made
the country a province, and called it Asia by the name of the
continent.</p>

<p>The Ca&iuml;cus flows past Pergamum through the plain of
Ca&iuml;cus, as it is called, and traverses a very fertile country, indeed
almost the best soil in Mysia.</p>

<p>3. The celebrated men in our times, natives of Pergamum,
were Mithridates, the son of Menodotus and the daughter of
Adobogion; he was of the family of the Tetrarchs of Galatia.
Adobogion, it is said, had been the concubine of Mithridates
the king; the relatives therefore gave to the child the name
of Mithridates, pretending that he was the king&#8217;s son.</p>

<p>This prince became so great a friend of divus C&aelig;sar, that he
was promoted to the honour of Tetrarch (of Galatia); out of
regard also to his mother&#8217;s family, he was appointed king of
Bosporus and of other places. He was overthrown by
Asander, who put to death Pharnaces the king and obtained
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]<br />[CAS. 625]</a></span>
possession of the Bosporus. He had a great reputation as
well as Apollodorus the rhetorician, who composed a work
on the Art of Rhetoric, and was the head of the Apollodorian
sect of philosophers, whatever that may be; for many
opinions have prevailed, the merits of which are beyond our
power to decide upon, among which are those of the sects
of Apollodorus and Theodorus.</p>

<p>But the friendship of Augustus C&aelig;sar, whom he instructed
in oratory, was the principal cause of the elevation of Apollodorus.
He had a celebrated scholar Dionysius, surnamed
Atticus, his fellow-citizen, who was an able teacher of philosophy,
an historian, and composer of orations.</p>

<p>4. Proceeding from the plain and the city towards the
east, we meet with Apollonia, a city on an elevated site. To
the south is a mountainous ridge, which having crossed on
the road to Sardes, we find on the left hand the city Thyateira,
a colony of the Macedonians, which some authors say
is the last city belonging to the Mysians. On the right hand
is Apollonis, 300 stadia from Pergamum, and the same distance
from Sardes. It has its name from Apollonis of Cyzicus
(wife of Attalus). Next are the plains of Hermus and Sardes.
The country to the north of Pergamum is principally
occupied by Mysians; it lies on the right hand of the people
called Aba&iuml;t&aelig;, on whose borders is the Epictetus, extending
to Bithynia.</p>

<p>5. Sardes is a large city, of later date than the Trojan
times, yet ancient, with a strong citadel. It was the royal
seat of the Lydians, whom the poet calls Meones, and later
writers M&aelig;ones, some asserting that they are the same,
others that they are a different people, but the former is the
preferable opinion.</p>

<p>Above Sardes is the Tmolus, a fertile mountain having on
its summit a seat<a name="FNanchor_1533" id="FNanchor_1533"></a><a href="#Footnote_1533" class="fnanchor">1533</a> of white marble, a work of the Persians.
There is a view from it of the plains around, particularly of
that of the Ca&yuml;ster. There dwell about it Lydians, Mysians,
and Macedonians.<a name="FNanchor_1534" id="FNanchor_1534"></a><a href="#Footnote_1534" class="fnanchor">1534</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span></p>

<p>The Pactolus flows from the Tmolus.<a name="FNanchor_1535" id="FNanchor_1535"></a><a href="#Footnote_1535" class="fnanchor">1535</a> It anciently brought
down a large quantity of gold-dust, whence, it is said, the
proverbial wealth of Cr&#339;sus and his ancestors obtained renown.
No gold-dust is found at present. The Pactolus descends
into the Hermus, into which also the Hyllus, now called
Phrygius, discharges itself. These three and other less considerable
rivers unite in one stream, and, according to Herodotus,
empty themselves into the sea at Phoc&aelig;a.</p>

<p>The Hermus takes its rise in Mysia, descending from the
sacred mountain of Dindymene, after traversing the Catacecaumene,
it enters the Sardian territory, and passes through
the contiguous plains to the sea, as we have mentioned above.
Below the city lie the plains of Sardes, of the Cyrus, of the
Hermus, and of the Ca&yuml;ster, which are contiguous to one
another and the most fertile anywhere to be found.</p>

<p>At the distance of 40 stadia from the city is the lake
Gyg&aelig;a, as it is called by the poet.<a name="FNanchor_1536" id="FNanchor_1536"></a><a href="#Footnote_1536" class="fnanchor">1536</a> Its name was afterwards
altered to Colo&euml;. Here was a temple of Artemis Colo&euml;ne,
held in the highest veneration. It is said that at the feasts
celebrated here the baskets dance.<a name="FNanchor_1537" id="FNanchor_1537"></a><a href="#Footnote_1537" class="fnanchor">1537</a> I know not why the circulation
of such strange and absurd stories should be preferred
to truth.</p>

<p><a name="xiii_iv_6" id="xiii_iv_6"></a>6. The verses in Homer are to this effect,</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;Mesthles and Antiphus, sons of Tal&aelig;menes, born of the lake Gyg&aelig;a,
were the leaders of the Meones, who live below Tmolus.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1538" id="FNanchor_1538"></a><a href="#Footnote_1538" class="fnanchor">1538</a></p>

<p>Some persons add a fourth verse to these,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;below snowy Tmolus, in the rich district of Hyda.&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But no Hyda<a name="FNanchor_1539" id="FNanchor_1539"></a><a href="#Footnote_1539" class="fnanchor">1539</a> is to be found among the Lydians. Others
make this the birth-place of Tychius, mentioned by the poet,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;he was the best leather-cutter in Hyda.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1540" id="FNanchor_1540"></a><a href="#Footnote_1540" class="fnanchor">1540</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>They add that the place is woody, and frequently struck with
lightning, and that here also were the dwellings of the Arimi;
for to this verse,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;Among the Arimi, where they say is the bed of Typho&euml;us,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1541" id="FNanchor_1541"></a><a href="#Footnote_1541" class="fnanchor">1541</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]<br />[CAS. 626]</a></span></p>

<p>they add the following,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;in a woody country, in the rich district of Hyda.&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Some lay the scene of the last fable in Cilicia, others in Syria,
others among the Pithecuss&aelig; (islands),<a name="FNanchor_1542" id="FNanchor_1542"></a><a href="#Footnote_1542" class="fnanchor">1542</a> who say that the
Pitheci (or monkeys) are called by the Tyrrhenians Arimi.
Some call Sardes Hyda; others give this name to its Acropolis.</p>

<p>The Scepsian (Demetrius) says that the opinion of those
authors is most to be depended upon who place the Arimi in
the Catacecaumene in Mysia. But Pindar associates the
Pithecuss&aelig; which lie in front of the Cym&aelig;an territory and
Sicily with Cilicia, for the poet says that Typhon lay beneath
&AElig;tna;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;Once he dwelt in far-famed Cilician caverns, but now Sicily, and the
sea-girt isle, o&#8217;ershadowing Cyme, press upon his shaggy breast.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1543" id="FNanchor_1543"></a><a href="#Footnote_1543" class="fnanchor">1543</a></p>

<p>And again,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;O&#8217;er him lies &AElig;tna, and in her vast prison holds him.&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>And again,</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;&#8217;Twas the great Jove alone of gods that o&#8217;erpowered, with resistless
force, the fifty-headed monster Typhon, of yore among the Arimi.&#8221;</p>

<p>Others understand Syrians by the Arimi, who are now called
Aram&aelig;i, and maintain that the Cilicians in the Troad migrated
and settled in Syria, and deprived the Syrians of the
country which is now called Cilicia.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span></p>

<p>Callisthenes says, that the Arimi from whom the mountains
in the neighbourhood have the name of Arima, are situated
near the Calycadnus,<a name="FNanchor_1544" id="FNanchor_1544"></a><a href="#Footnote_1544" class="fnanchor">1544</a> and the promontory Sarpedon close to
the Corycian cave.</p>

<p>7. The monuments of the kings lie around the lake Colo&euml;.
At Sardes is the great mound of Alyattes upon a lofty base,
the work, according to Herodotus,<a name="FNanchor_1545" id="FNanchor_1545"></a><a href="#Footnote_1545" class="fnanchor">1545</a> of the people of the city,
the greatest part of it being executed by young women. He
says that they all prostituted themselves; according to some
writers the sepulchre is the monument of a courtesan.</p>

<p>Some historians say, that Colo&euml; is an artificial lake, designed
to receive the superabundant waters of the rivers when they
are full and overflow.</p>

<p>Hyp&aelig;pa<a name="FNanchor_1546" id="FNanchor_1546"></a><a href="#Footnote_1546" class="fnanchor">1546</a> is a city situated on the descent from Tmolus to
the plain of the Ca&yuml;ster.</p>

<p>8. Callisthenes says that Sardes was taken first by Cimmerians,
then by Treres and Lycians, which Callinus also,
the elegiac poet, testifies, and that it was last captured in the
time of Cyrus and Cr&#339;sus. When Callinus says that the
incursion of the Cimmerians when they took Sardes was
directed against the Esioneis, the Scepsian (Demetrius) supposes
the Asioneis to be called by him Esioneis, according to
the Ionian dialect; for perhaps Meonia, he says, was called
Asia, as Homer describes the country, &#8220;in the Asian meadows
about the streams of Ca&yuml;strius.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1547" id="FNanchor_1547"></a><a href="#Footnote_1547" class="fnanchor">1547</a> The city, on account
of the fertility of the country, was afterwards restored, so as
to be a considerable place, and was inferior to none of its
neighbours; lately it has lost a great part of its buildings by
earthquakes. But Sardes, and many other cities which participated
in this calamity about the same time, have been repaired
by the provident care and beneficence of Tiberius the present
emperor.</p>

<p>9. The distinguished natives of Sardes were two orators of
the same name and family, the Diodori; the elder of whom was
called Zonas, who had pleaded the cause of Asia in many suits.
But at the time of the invasion of Mithridates the king, he was
accused of occasioning the revolt of the cities from him, but
in his defence he cleared himself of the charge.</p>

<p>The younger Diodorus was my friend; there exist of his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]<br />[CAS. 628]</a></span>
historical writings, odes, and poems of other kinds, which very
much resemble the style of the ancients.</p>

<p>Xanthus, the ancient historian, is said to be a Lydian,
but whether of Sardes I do not know.</p>

<p>10. After the Lydians are the Mysians, and a city Philadelphia,
subject to constant earthquakes. The walls of the
houses are incessantly opening, and sometimes one, sometimes
another, part of the city is experiencing some damage. The
majority of people (for few persons live in the city) pass their
lives in the country, employing themselves in agriculture and
cultivating a good soil. Yet it is surprising that there should
be even a few persons so much attached to a place where
their dwellings are insecure; but one may marvel more at
those who founded the city.</p>

<p>11. Next is the tract of country called the Catacecaumene,
extending 500 stadia in length, and in breadth 400. It is
uncertain whether it should be called Mysia or Meonia, for
it has both names. The whole country is devoid of trees, excepting
vines, from which is obtained the Catacecaumenite
wine; it is not inferior in quality to any of the kinds in repute.
The surface of the plains is covered with ashes, but the
hilly and rocky part is black, as if it were the effect of combustion.
This, as some persons imagine, was the effect of
thunderbolts and of fiery tempests, nor do they hesitate to
make it the scene of the fable of Typhon. Xanthus even says
that a certain Arimus was king of these parts. But it is
unreasonable to suppose that so large a tract of country was
all at once consumed by lightning and fiery meteors; it is
more natural to suppose that the effect was produced by fire
generated in the soil, the sources of which are now exhausted.
There are to be seen three pits, which are called Phys&aelig;, or
breathing holes, situated at the distance of 40 stadia from each
other. Above are rugged hills, which probably consist of
masses of matter thrown up by blasts of air (from the pits).</p>

<p>That ground of this kind should be well adapted to vines,
may be conceived from the nature of the country Catana,<a name="FNanchor_1548" id="FNanchor_1548"></a><a href="#Footnote_1548" class="fnanchor">1548</a>
which was a mass of cinders, but which now produces excellent
wine, and in large quantities.</p>

<p>Some persons, in allusion to such countries as these, wittily
observe that Bacchus is properly called Pyrigenes, or fire-born.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span></p>

<p>12. The places situated next to these towards the south,
and extending to Mount Taurus, are so intermixed, that parts
of Phrygia, Lydia, Caria, and Mysia running into one another
are difficult to be distinguished. The Romans have contributed
not a little to produce this confusion, by not dividing
the people according to tribes, but following another principle
have arranged them according to jurisdictions, in which they
have appointed days for holding courts and administering
justice.</p>

<p>The Tmolus is a well compacted mass of mountain,<a name="FNanchor_1549" id="FNanchor_1549"></a><a href="#Footnote_1549" class="fnanchor">1549</a> of
moderate circumference, and its boundaries are within Lydia
itself. The Mesogis begins, according to Theopompus, from
Cel&aelig;n&aelig;,<a name="FNanchor_1550" id="FNanchor_1550"></a><a href="#Footnote_1550" class="fnanchor">1550</a> and extends on the opposite side as far as Mycale,<a name="FNanchor_1551" id="FNanchor_1551"></a><a href="#Footnote_1551" class="fnanchor">1551</a>
so that Phrygians occupy one part, towards Cel&aelig;n&aelig; and
Apameia; Mysians and Lydians another; Carians and Ionians
a third part.</p>

<p>So also the rivers, and particularly the M&aelig;ander, are the
actual boundaries of some nations, but take their course
through the middle of others, rendering accurate distinction
between them difficult.</p>

<p>The same may be said of plains, which are found on each
side of a mountainous range and on each side of a river. Our
attention however is not required to obtain the same degree of
accuracy as a surveyor, but only to give such descriptions as
have been transmitted to us by our predecessors.</p>

<p>13. Contiguous on the east to the plain of Ca&yuml;ster, which
lies between the Mesogis and Tmolus, is the plain Cilbianum.
It is extensive, well inhabited, and fertile. Then follows the
Hyrcanian plain, a name given by the Persians, who brought
colonists from Hyrcania (the plain of Cyrus, in like manner,
had its name from the Persians). Next is the Peltine plain,
belonging to the Phrygians, and the Cillanian and the Tabenian
plains, the latter of which contains small towns, inhabited
by a mixed population of Phrygians, with a portion of Pisidians.
The plains have their names from the towns.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]<br />[CAS. 629]</a></span></p>

<p>14. After crossing the Mesogis, situated between the Carians<a name="FNanchor_1552" id="FNanchor_1552"></a><a href="#Footnote_1552" class="fnanchor">1552</a>
and the district of Nysa,<a name="FNanchor_1553" id="FNanchor_1553"></a><a href="#Footnote_1553" class="fnanchor">1553</a> which is a tract of country beyond
the M&aelig;ander, extending as far as the Cibyratis and
Cabalis, we meet with cities. Near the Mesogis, opposite
Laodicea,<a name="FNanchor_1554" id="FNanchor_1554"></a><a href="#Footnote_1554" class="fnanchor">1554</a> is Hierapolis,<a name="FNanchor_1555" id="FNanchor_1555"></a><a href="#Footnote_1555" class="fnanchor">1555</a> where are hot springs, and the Plutonium,
both of which have some singular properties. The
water of the springs is so easily consolidated and becomes
stone, that if it is conducted through water-courses dams are
formed consisting of a single piece of stone.</p>

<p>The Plutonium, situated below a small brow of the overhanging
mountain, is an opening of sufficient size to admit a
man, but there is a descent to a great depth. In front is a
quadrilateral railing, about half a plethrum in circumference.
This space is filled with a cloudy and dark vapour, so dense
that the bottom can scarcely be discerned. To those who approach
round the railing the air is innoxious, for in calm
weather it is free from the cloud which then continues within
the enclosure. But animals which enter within the railing
die instantly. Even bulls, when brought within it, fall down
and are taken out dead. We have ourselves thrown in sparrows,
which immediately fell down lifeless. The Galli,<a name="FNanchor_1556" id="FNanchor_1556"></a><a href="#Footnote_1556" class="fnanchor">1556</a> who
are eunuchs, enter the enclosure with impunity, approach
even the opening or mouth, bend down over it, and descend
into it to a certain depth, restraining their breath during the
time, for we perceived by their countenance signs of some
suffocating feeling. This exemption may be common to all
eunuchs, or it may be confined to the eunuchs employed about
the temple, or it may be the effect of divine care, as is probable
in the case of persons inspired by the deity, or it may
perhaps be procured by those who are in possession of certain
antidotes.</p>

<p>The conversion of water into stone is said to be the property
of certain rivers in Laodiceia, although the water is fit
for the purpose of drinking. The water at Hierapolis is peculiarly
adapted for the dyeing of wool. Substances dyed with
&#8220;the roots,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1557" id="FNanchor_1557"></a><a href="#Footnote_1557" class="fnanchor">1557</a> rival in colour those dyed with the coccus, or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
the marine purple. There is such an abundance of water,
that there are natural baths in every part of the city.</p>

<p>15. After Hierapolis are the parts beyond the M&aelig;ander.
Those about Laodiceia and Aphrodisias,<a name="FNanchor_1558" id="FNanchor_1558"></a><a href="#Footnote_1558" class="fnanchor">1558</a> and those extending
to Carura, have been already described. The places which
succeed are Antiocheia<a name="FNanchor_1559" id="FNanchor_1559"></a><a href="#Footnote_1559" class="fnanchor">1559</a> on the M&aelig;ander, now belonging to
Caria, on the west; on the south are Cibyra the Great,<a name="FNanchor_1560" id="FNanchor_1560"></a><a href="#Footnote_1560" class="fnanchor">1560</a> Sinda,<a name="FNanchor_1561" id="FNanchor_1561"></a><a href="#Footnote_1561" class="fnanchor">1561</a>
and Cabalis, as far as Mount Taurus and Lycia.</p>

<p>Antiocheia is a city of moderate size situated on the banks
of the M&aelig;ander, at the side towards Phrygia. There is a
bridge over the river. A large tract of country, all of which
is fertile, on each side of the river, belongs to the city. It
produces in the greatest abundance the fig of Antioch, as it is
called, which is dried. It is also called Triphyllus. This
place also is subject to shocks of earthquakes.</p>

<p>A native of this city was Diotrephes, a celebrated sophist;
his disciple was Hybreas, the greatest orator of our times.</p>

<p>16. The Cabaleis, it is said, were Solymi. The hill situated
above the Termessian fortress is called Solymus, and the
Termessians themselves Solymi. Near these places is the
rampart of Bellerophon and the sepulchre of Peisandrus his son,
who fell in the battle against the Solymi. This account agrees
with the words of the poet. Of Bellerophon he speaks thus,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
&#8220;he fought a second time with the brave Solymi;&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1562" id="FNanchor_1562"></a><a href="#Footnote_1562" class="fnanchor">1562</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>and of his son,</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;Mars, unsated with war, killed Peisandrus his son fighting with the
Solymi.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1563" id="FNanchor_1563"></a><a href="#Footnote_1563" class="fnanchor">1563</a></p>

<p>Termessus is a Pisidian city situated very near and immediately
above Cibyra.</p>

<p>17. The Cibyrat&aelig; are said to be descendants of the Lydians
who occupied the territory Cabalis. The city was afterwards in
the possession of the Pisidians, a bordering nation, who occupied
it, and transferred it to another place, very strongly fortified,
the circuit of which was about 100 stadia. It flourished in consequence
of the excellence of its laws. The villages belonging
to it extended from Pisidia, and the bordering territory Milyas,
as far as Lycia and the country opposite to Rhodes. Upon the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]<br />[CAS. 631]</a></span>
union of the three bordering cities, Bubon,<a name="FNanchor_1564" id="FNanchor_1564"></a><a href="#Footnote_1564" class="fnanchor">1564</a> Balbura,<a name="FNanchor_1565" id="FNanchor_1565"></a><a href="#Footnote_1565" class="fnanchor">1565</a> and
&#338;noanda,<a name="FNanchor_1566" id="FNanchor_1566"></a><a href="#Footnote_1566" class="fnanchor">1566</a> the confederation was called Tetrapolis; each city
had one vote, except Cibyra, which had two, for it could equip
30,000 foot soldiers and 2000 horse. It was always governed
by tyrants, but they ruled with moderation. The tyrannical
government terminated in the time of Moagetes. It was
overthrown by Murena, who annexed Balbura and Bubon to
the Lycians. Nevertheless the Cibyratic district is reckoned
among the largest jurisdictions in Asia.</p>

<p>The Cibyrat&aelig; used four languages, the Pisidic, that of Solymi,
the Greek, and the Lydian, but of the latter no traces
are now to be found in Lydia.</p>

<p>At Cibyra there is practised the peculiar art of carving
with ease ornamental work in iron.</p>

<p>Milya is the mountain-range extending from the defiles
near Termessus, and the passage through them to the parts
within the Taurus towards Isinda, as far as Sagalassus and
the country of Apameia.</p>

epithet of Laced&aelig;mon, hollow, cannot properly be applied to the country,
for this peculiarity of the city does not with any propriety agree with the
epithets given to the country; unless we suppose the epithet to be a poetical
licence. For, as has been before remarked, it must be concluded
from the words of the poet himself, that Messene was then a part of Laconia,
and subject to Menelaus. It would then be a contradiction (in
Homer) not to join Messene, which took part in the expedition, with
Laconia or the Pylus under Nestor, nor to place by itself in the Catalogue,
as though it had no part in the expedition.</p></div>

the Muses were called Aganippides, is the fountain which issues from the
left bank of the torrent flowing midway between Paleopanaghea and
Pyrgaki. Around this fountain Leake observed numerous square blocks,
and in the neighbouring fields stones and remains of habitations. The
position of the Grove of the Muses is fixed at St. Nicholas, by an inscription
which Leake discovered there relating to the Museia, or the games
of the Muses, which were celebrated there under the presidency of the
Thespians. Paus. b. ix. c. 31. In the time of Pausanias the Grove of
the Muses contained a larger number of statues than any other place in
B&#339;otia, and this writer has given an account of many of them. The
statues of the Muses were removed by Constantine from this place to his

the village of Mazi, on the road from Thebes to Lebadeia, and at the distance
of about 15 miles from either place. Although the walls of the
town are scarcely anywhere traceable, its extent is marked on the east
and west by two small rivers, of which that to the west issues from the
foot of the hill of Mazi, the eastern, called the Kafalari, has its origin in
Mount Helicon. The stream on the western side of the city is the one
called Hoplites by Plutarch, where Lysander fell in battle with the Thebans,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B. C.</span> 395, and is apparently the same as the Lophis of Pausanias.
The stream on the eastern side, the Kafalari, is formed by the union of
two rivulets, which appear to be the Permessus and Olmeius, which are
described by Strabo as flowing from Helicon, and after their union entering
the Lake Copais, near Haliartus. <i>Smith.</i></p></div>

trees, near the ruins of Glisas or Glissas, which was the burial-place of

The myths relating to the Curetes abound with different statements
and confusion. The following are the only points to be borne in mind.
The Curetes belong to the most ancient times of Greece, and probably
are to be counted among the first inhabitants of Phrygia. They were the
authors and expositors of certain religious rites, which they celebrated
with dances. According to mythology they played a part at the birth of
Jupiter. They were sometimes called Id&aelig;an Dactyli. Hence their
name was given to the ministers of the worship of the Great Mother
among the Phrygians, which was celebrated with a kind of religious
frenzy. The Curetes were also called Corybantes. Hence also arose the
confusion between the religious rites observed in Crete, Phrygia, and
Samothrace. Again, on the other hand, the Curetes have been mistaken
for an &AElig;tolian people, bearing the same name. Heyne, Not. ad Virgil.

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_752" id="Footnote_752"></a><a href="#FNanchor_752"><span class="label">752</span></a> The common European name Candia is unknown in the island; the
Saracenic &#8220;Kandax,&#8221; Megalo Kastron, became with the Venetian writers
Candia; the word for a long time denoted only the principal city of the
island, which retained its ancient name in the chroniclers and in Dante,
Inferno xiv. 94. It is described by Strabo as lying between Cyrenaica
and that part of Hellas which extends from Sunium to Laconia, and
parallel in its length from W. to E. of these two points. The words
&#956;&#8051;&#967;&#961;&#953; &#923;&#945;&#954;&#969;&#957;&#953;&#954;&#8134;&#962; may be understood either of Malea or T&aelig;narum; it is
probable that this geographer extended Crete as far as T&aelig;narum, as from
other passages in his work (ii. c. v. &sect; 20; viii. c. v. &sect; 1) it would appear
that he considered it and the W. points of Crete as under the same
meridian. It is still more difficult to understand the position assigned to
Crete with regard to Cyrenaica (xvii. c. iii. &sect; 22). Strabo is far nearer
the truth, though contradicting his former statements, where he makes
Cimarus, the N.W. promontory of Crete, 700 stadia from Malea, and Cape
Sammonium 1000 stadia from Rhodes, (ii. c. iv. &sect; 3,) which was one of
the best ascertained points of ancient geography. <i>Smith</i>, v. Crete.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_754" id="Footnote_754"></a><a href="#FNanchor_754"><span class="label">754</span></a> Gossellin observes that the false position assigned to these countries,
and the contradiction perceptible in the measures in stadia, given by
Strabo, and above all the impossibility of reconciling them upon one given
plan, is a proof that the author consulted different histories, and different
maps, in which the distances were laid down in stadia differing in length.</p></div>

that the promontory Cimarus is mentioned by no other author. Corycus
on the other hand is placed by Strabo below, &sect; 5, in these parts, although
the reading is suspicious, and in b. viii. c. v. &sect; 1, and in b. xvii. c. iii.

Cimarus is now C. Buso or Grabusa.</p></div>

with two islands bearing the name of Leros. One, from the position he
assigns to it, appears to be the one Strabo above speaks of under the
name of Leria; but the second Leros of Pliny, b. v. &sect; 36, must be placed
on the coast of Caria. Strabo appears to have entertained nearly the
same ideas, for we shall hereafter (b. xiv. c. i. &sect; 6) see him give the name
of Leros to an island situated in the neighbourhood of Icaria; and below
(&sect; 19) he cites also a Leros, which would seem to have been in the neighbourhood
of the southern extremity of Caria.</p></div>

the ideas of our author, we must bear in mind, that (1) he supposed the
source of the Don to have been situated in the neighbourhood of the
Northern Ocean; (2) he imagined the Caspian Sea to communicate with
the same Ocean. Thus all the territory comprehended between the Don
and the Caspian formed a sort of peninsula, united to the continent by an
isthmus which separated the Euxine from the Caspian, and on which was
situated Colchis, Iberia, and Albania. The 3000 stadia assigned to the
breadth of this isthmus appears to be measured by stadia of 1111-1/9 to a degree.

provinces of Persia. Their exact position was at the division of Parthia
from Media, about a day&#8217;s journey from the Median town of Rhag&aelig;.
(Arrian. iii. 19.) According to Isodorus Charax, they were immediately
below Mt. Caspius. As in the case of the people called Caspii, there
seem to have been <i>two</i> mountains <i>Caspius</i>, one near the Armenian frontier,
the other near the Parthian. It was through the pass of the Caspi&aelig;
Pyl&aelig; that Alexander the Great pursued Darius. (Arrian. <i>Anab.</i> iii. 19;
Curt. vi. 14; Amm. Marc, xxiii. 6.) It was one of the most important
places in ancient geography, and from it many of the meridians were measured.
The exact place corresponding with the Caspi&aelig; Pyl&aelig; is probably a
spot between <i>Hark-a-Koh</i>, and <i>Siah-Koh</i>, about 6 parasangs from <i>Rey</i>, the

passage therefore seems to present great difficulties. The difficulties
respecting the parallel can only be perceived by an examination and

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1023" id="Footnote_1023"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1023"><span class="label">1023</span></a> I do not see where this statement is to be found, except implicitly.
Strabo seems to refer us in general to various passages where he endeavours
to determine the greatest length of the habitable world, in b. ii.
<i>Du Theil</i>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1024" id="Footnote_1024"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1024"><span class="label">1024</span></a> I am unable to fix upon the author&#8217;s train of thought. For immediately
after having assigned to this portion of the Habitable Earth (whose
dimensions he wishes to determine) 30,000 stadia as its &#8220;greatest length,&#8221;
and 10,000 stadia as its &#8220;greatest breadth,&#8221; Strabo proceeds to prove
what he had just advanced respecting its greatest length. Then he
should, it seems, have endeavoured to furnish us, in the same manner,
with a proof that its greatest breadth is not more, as he says, than 10,000.
But in what follows there is nothing advanced on this point; all that he
says is to develope another proposition, viz. that the extent of the Hyrcanian&mdash;Caspian
Sea is at the utmost 6000 stadia.
</p><p>
The arguments contained in this paragraph on the whole appear to me
strange; they rest on a basis which it is difficult to comprehend; they
establish explicitly a proposition which disagrees with what the author
has said elsewhere, and lastly they present an enormous geographical
error.
</p><p>
It will therefore be useful to the reader to explain, as far as I understand
it, the argument of our author.
</p><p>
1. The exact form of the chlamys is unknown to us, but it was such, that
its greatest <i>breadth</i> was to be found, if not exactly in, at least near, the
middle of its <i>length</i>. The Habitable Earth being of the form of a
Chlamys, its greatest <i>breadth</i> would be found about the middle of its
greatest <i>length</i>.
</p><p>
2. The greatest <i>length</i> of the Habitable World being 70,000 stadia, its
greatest <i>breadth</i> ought to be found at the distance of 35,000 stadia from
its eastern or western extremity, but this greatest <i>breadth</i> is only 30,000
stadia, and it does not extend, on the north, beyond the parallel of the
mouth of the Hyrcanian Sea. B. ii.
</p><p>
3. The meridian which passes at the distance of 35,000 stadia from the
eastern or western extremities of the Habitable Earth, is that which,
drawn from the mouth of the Hyrcanian Sea to the Northern Ocean, and
prolonged in another direction through the mouth of the Persian Gulf
to the sea called Erythr&aelig;an, would pass through the city Artemita. Consequently
it is on the meridian of Artemita that we must look for the
greatest breadth of the Habitable Earth.
</p><p>
4. On this same meridian, we must reckon from the parallel of the
last habitable country in the south to the mouth of the Persian Gulf,
about 8000 stadia; then from the mouth of the Persian Gulf to Artemita,
8000 stadia; and from Artemita to the bottom of the Hyrcanian Sea,
8000 stadia: total 24,000 stadia.
</p><p>

and other writers, eighty years after the capture of Troy, some
critics have imagined that the text of Strabo in this passage should be
changed from &#7953;&#958;&#8053;&#954;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#945; &#7956;&#964;&#949;&#963;&#953;, sixty years, to &#8000;&#947;&#948;&#959;&#8053;&#954;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#945; &#7956;&#964;&#949;&#963;&#953;, eighty years.
Thucydides, in the same chapter, and in the space of a few lines, speaks of
the return of the B&#339;otians to their own country, as having taken place
sixty years after the capture of Troy; and of the return of the Heracleid&aelig;
to the Peloponnesus, as having taken place eighty years after the same
event; it is probable that Strabo, who followed Thucydides, substituted,
through inattention, one number for another.</p></div>

be here observed that the confusion of names of those parts in the Turkish

below, c. i. &sect; 70. But perhaps this division was only invented for
the purpose of completing the number of the nine principalities, for
Strabo above, c. i. &sect; 2, speaks in a manner to let us suppose that other
authors reckoned eight only. However this may be, the following is the
number of the dynasties or principalities established by our author. 1.
That of Mynes; 2. that of Eetion, both in Cilicia; 3. that of Altes; 4.
that of Hector; 5. that of &AElig;neas; 6. that of Pandarus; 7. that of

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1350" id="Footnote_1350"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1350"><span class="label">1350</span></a> Granting to Priam the sovereignty of the districts just mentioned by
Strabo, his dominion extended over a country about twenty maritime
leagues in length and the same in breadth. It would be impossible to determine
the exact limits of these different districts, but it is seen that
</p><p>
The Trojans, properly so called, occupied the basin of the Scamander
(Menderes-Tschai).
</p><p>
The Cilicians, commanded by Eetion, occupied the territory which surrounds
the present Gulf of Adramytti.
</p><p>
The Cilicians of Mynes were to the south of the above.
</p><p>
The Leleges extended along a part of the northern coast of the Gulf of
Adramytti, from Cape Baba.
</p><p>
The Dardanians were above the Trojans, and the chain of Ida. On the
north, extending on both sides of the Hellespont, were the people of
Arisbe, Sestos, and Abydos.
</p><p>
The people of Adrasteia occupied the Propontis, as far as the Granicus.
</p><p>
The Lycians, the country beyond, as far as the &AElig;sepus and Zeleia.
</p><p>
Strabo mentioned a ninth (c. i. &sect; 2) principality subject to Priam; he
does not mention it by name, or rather it is wanting in the text. M. de
Choiseul-Gouffier, (Voyage Pittoresque de la Gr&egrave;ce, vol. ii.,) with much
probability, thinks that this principality was that of the island of Lesbos.

of Scepsis, whose opinions on what regards these rivers and the position
of Troy are quoted by Strabo, constantly takes the Simo&iuml;s or Mender&eacute;
for the Scamander of Homer. The researches of M. de Choiseul-Gouffier

Artayctes, one of the generals of Xerxes, pillaged the temple and profaned

on the coast of the Troad, at the entrance of the Hellespont, appears
to have been comprehended between the hillock called the Tomb of
Achilles and the southern base of the heights, on which is situated another
tomb, which goes by the name of the Tomb of Ajax. This space of
about 1500 toises in length, now sand and lagunes, where the village
Koum Kale and the fortress called the New Castle of Asia stand, and
which spreads across the mouth of the Mender&eacute;, once formed a creek, the
bottom of which, from examination on the spot, extended 1200 or 1500
toises from the present shore. It is from the bottom of this marshy
creek the 12 stadia must be measured which Strabo reckons from the
Port of the Ach&aelig;ans to New Ilium. These 12 stadia, estimated at 700 to
a degree, (like the generality of other measures adopted by Strabo in this
district,) are equal to 977 toises, and conduct in a straight line to the
western point of the mountain Tchiblak, where there are remains of
buildings which may be the vestiges of New Ilium.

The other 30 stadia, which, according to Strabo, or rather according to
Demetrius of Scepsis, was the distance from New Ilium to the town of
the Ilienses, are equal to 2440 toises, and terminate at the most eastern
edge of the table-land of Tchiblak, in a spot where ruins of a temple and
other edifices are seen. Thus there is nothing to prevent our taking this
place for the site of the town of the Ilienses, and this is the opinion of
many modern travellers. But did this town occupy the same ground as
the ancient Ilium, as Demetrius of Scepsis believed? Strabo thinks not,
and we shall hereafter see the objections he has to offer against the opinion
of Demetrius.&mdash;<i>Gossellin.</i></p></div>

The topography of the plain of Troy and its neighbourhood is not yet
sufficiently known to be able to distinguish all the details given by Demetrius.
It appears only that he took the Tchiblak for the Simo&iuml;s, and
placed the plain of Troy to the right of the present Mender&eacute;, which he
called the Scamander. This opinion, lately renewed by Major Rennell,
presents great and even insurmountable difficulties when we endeavour to
explain on this basis the principal circumstances of the Iliad. It must be
remembered that in the time of Demetrius the remembrance of the position
of ancient Troy was entirely lost, and that this author constantly
reasoned on the hypothesis, much contested in his time, that the town of
the Ilienses corresponded with that of ancient Ilium. <i>Observations on

highest summit of the mountain Bounar-bachi, acknowledges that the
nature of the ground would prevent the course of Hector and Achilles
taking place round this position, in consequence of the rivers and the precipices
which surround it on the S. E. To meet the objection which
these facts would give rise to, M. Lechevalier interprets the expressions
of Homer in a manner never thought of by the ancient grammarians,
although they contorted the text in every possible manner, to bend it to
their peculiar opinions. Would it not be more easy to believe that at
the time of the siege of Troy this city was no longer on the summit of
the mountain, nor so near its ancient acropolis as it was at first; and that
the inhabitants moved under the reign of Ilus, as Plato says, and as Homer
leads us to conclude, to the entrance of the plain and to the lower
rising grounds of Ida? The level ground on the top mountain which
rises above Bounar-bachi, and on which it has been attempted to trace the
contour of the walls of ancient Ilium and of its citadel, is more than 3200
toises in circumference.
</p><p>
But it is difficult to conceive how, at so distant a period and among a
people half savage, a space of ground so large and without water could
be entirely occupied by a town, whose power scarcely extended beyond
25 leagues. On the other hand, as the exterior circuit of this mountain
is more than 5500 toises, it is not to be conceived how Homer, so exact
in his description of places, should have represented Achilles and Hector,
already fatigued by a long-continued battle, as making an uninterrupted
course of about seven leagues round this mountain, before commencing
in single combat. It appears to me therefore that the Troy of Homer
must have covered a much less space of ground than is generally supposed,
and according to all appearances this space was bounded by a
hillock, on which is now the village of Bounar-bachi. This hillock is
about 700 or 800 toises in circumference; it is isolated from the rest of the
mountain; and warriors in pursuing one another could easily make the
circuit. This would not prevent Pergamus from being the citadel of
Ilium, but it was separated from it by an esplanade, which served as a
means of communication between the town and the fortress.&mdash;<i>Gossellin.</i></p></div>

river which Demetrius calls Scamander, at more than 30,000 toises, or
nearly eleven leagues, to the S. E. of the entrance of the Hellespont,
when the source of the Scamander should be near Troy; and Troy itself,
according to the measurement adopted by Demetrius, ought not to be
more than 3400 toises, or a league and a quarter, from the sea. There is
therefore a manifest contradiction, and it appears, as I have already remarked,
that the river called Scamander by Demetrius, is not the river so
called by Homer, but the Simo&iuml;s of the poet.&mdash;<i>Gossellin.</i>
</p><p>
Modern travellers accuse Demetrius with having confounded the Scamander
with the Simo&iuml;s. The Simo&iuml;s they say rises in Cotylus, (Kas-dagh,)
as also the Granicus, (Oustrola,) and the &AElig;sepus, (Satal-dere,)
but the sources of the Scamander are below, and to the W. of Ida, near
the village called by the Turks Bounar-bachi, which signifies the head of
the source. If it is an error, Demetrius is not alone responsible for it,
as Hellenicus (Schol. in Iliad xxi. 242) also says that the Scamander
had its source in Mount Ida itself. Both probably rested on the authority
of Homer, who places the source of the Scamander in Ida. They did
not, however, observe that Homer employs the expression &#7936;&#960;&#8217; &#7992;&#948;&#945;&#8055;&#969;&#957; &#8000;&#961;&#8051;&#969;&#957; in a more extensive sense.&mdash;<i>Du Theil.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1436" id="Footnote_1436"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1436"><span class="label">1436</span></a> We owe to the researches of M. de Choiseul Gouffier, published
without his knowledge in 1793, an acquaintance with these two springs,
which present nearly the same phenomena as described by Homer.
These springs have since been seen by many travellers; they are situated
at the foot of a small hill on which is Bounar-bachi, and about 6500
toises in a straight line from the mouth of the Mender&eacute;. The stream which
flows from them never fails, and after having run for some time parallel
to the Mender&eacute;, it turns suddenly to throw itself into the Archipelago,
near the middle of the interval which separates the ruins of Alesandria-Troas
from the cape Koum-kale, but still leaving traces of a bed through
which it formerly flowed to join the Mender&eacute;. We are now convinced
that this little river is the Scamander of Homer, that the present Mender&eacute;
is the Simo&iuml;s of that poet, and that the ancient Ilium, which was
near the sources of the Scamander, must have been situated on the
heights of Bounar-bachi.
</p><p>
In the time of Homer these two rivers united together and discharged
themselves into the sea by the same mouth: but the course of the Scamander
has been changed for a long time, since, according to Pliny, (v.
c. 33,) a part of its waters spread themselves over a marsh, and the remainder
flowed unto the &AElig;g&aelig;an Sea, between Alexandria-Troas and
Sigeum. This ancient author therefore gave to the little river (which
he called Pal&#339;scamander, the old Scamander) exactly the same course
which the stream Bounar-bachi still follows. This change of direction
in the course of the river appears to me to have been anterior to the time
of Demetrius of Scepsis, for this alone can explain his error. For, no
longer finding a stream which runs on the left of the present Mender&eacute;,
and which might represent the Scamander, he thought proper to transfer
this latter name to the Simo&iuml;s, and to look for the site of the Ilium of
Homer, as also of the plain which was the scene of the combats described
by the poet, on the right of this river. Thence he is persuaded
that the town of the Ilienses occupied the same site as the ancient Ilium,
and that the stream of the Tschiblak was the Simo&iuml;s.
</p><p>
I must remark that the Mender&eacute; is a torrent, the waters of which fail
during a great part of the year, whilst the stream of the Bounar-bachi
always continues to flow. This advantage is probably the reason why it
preserved the name of Scamander to the sea, although it ran into the bed
of the Simo&iuml;s and was far inferior to this torrent in the length of its course.
Hence it may be perceived how the name of Scamander, now changed
into that of Mender&eacute;, has remained attached to this ancient mouth, how
ultimately it was given to the whole course of the Simo&iuml;s, and how Demetrius
of Scepsis was led into error by the change in the course of the
true Scamander, and by the transfer of its name to the Simo&iuml;s.&mdash;Voyage

who assert that Pisistratus, tyrant of Athens, and Polycrates, tyrant of
Samos, were the first who formed libraries. The libraries of these two
princes, who lived six centuries before our time, were probably confined
to half a dozen poets, and it may be supposed that the care Pisistratus
took to collect the poems of Homer did not extend to poets posterior to
his time. But in the time of Aristotle there existed many poems, a
great number of oratorical discourses, historical works, and various
treatises of philosophy.</p></div>

From what Athen&aelig;us, b. v., says of him, he appears to have used his
great wealth for the purposes of ostentation rather than of employing it
for the benefit of others. He was sent by Aristion, (or Athenion, as
Athen&aelig;us calls him,) tyrant of Athens, to Delos, at the head of ten thousand
soldiers, to remove the treasures of the temple. He was defeated
by the Romans, and having lost his whole army, escaped with difficulty.</p></div>

one, but which did not contain the fundamental dogmas which Aristotle
only communicated to those of his own school. The books which contained
these doctrines were called, by way of distinction, <i>esoteric</i>. Such
at least is the opinion of those who admit of the existence of a secret doctrine,
and a public doctrine, in the philosophy of Aristotle. This passage
of Strabo however seems to favour those who maintained a different
opinion, namely, that this celebrated distinction of <i>exoteric</i> and <i>esoteric</i>
doctrines, which is peculiar to the works of Aristotle, is not founded on
any essential difference of doctrine, but rather on a difference of method,
so that the word <i>exoteric</i> was applied to works where the opinions of the
philosopher were set forth in a manner to be understood by all intelligent
readers, whether of his own school or strangers; and <i>esoteric</i> to those
works where his opinions were thoroughly discussed, and in a scientific
manner, and which, not being intelligible to every one, required to be explained
by the master himself.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1475" id="Footnote_1475"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1475"><span class="label">1475</span></a> Metrodorus was not only a fellow-countryman of Demetrius, who was
one of the richest and most distinguished citizens of Scepsis, but also his
contemporary and proteg&eacute;. A small treatise of Metrodorus is cited, entitled
&#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#7936;&#955;&#949;&#953;&#960;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8134;&#962;, which may mean &#8220;on anointing with oil,&#8221; or
&#8220;on oil used in the public exercises.&#8221; It seems however very probable
that the treatise on the Troad, (&#932;&#961;&#969;&iuml;&#954;&#8048;,) which Athen&aelig;us attributes to
another Metrodorus of Chios, was the work of this Metrodorus of Scepsis.
The place of his birth, which was in the Troad, might have suggested,
as it did to his patron, the idea of treating a subject liable to discussion,
and to endeavour to throw light upon it by the words of Homer. Add to
this that Strabo quotes also Metrodorus on the subject of the Amazons,
whose history appears so closely connected with the Trojan war that all
who have touched on the one, have also treated of the other. Pliny quotes
also a Metrodorus on the subject of the serpents of the river Rhyndacus,
near the Troad. It is also a question whether Metrodorus was one of
those who occupied themselves with mnemonics, or the art of increasing
and strengthening the memory. According to Plutarch, Metrodorus
was the victim of Mithridates. Tigranes, who had placed the philosopher
in his power, more from inadvertence than intentionally, so much
regretted his death that he celebrated magnificent obsequies to his
memory.</p></div>

meant by the latter name the territory of Gargara, a distinction we find
made below between Pedasa and Pedasis. The author of the Etymologicum

abandoned it on account of the cold, it being situated on Mount Ida;
that they founded a new town in the plain, and that the town abandoned
afterwards received the name of Old Gargara.

rather than the kings of Persia, as understood by Rambach (De Mileto
ejusque coloni&aelig;); for if we suppose that colonists are here meant who
came to Gargara from Miletus after the destruction of this latter town by
the Persians, how could Demetrius of Scepsis say of the Gargareans
that, &#8220;&AElig;olians as they were, or instead of &AElig;olians they became semi-barbarians?&#8221;
He ought at least to have said, &#8220;that they became Ionians,&#8221;
for Miletus, a Greek city of Ionia, at the time of its destruction by
the Persians, was far from being barbarous. But Miletopolis, although
from its name and position in the territory of Cyzicus was probably, like
Cyzicus, a colony of Miletus, yet might have been peopled with barbarians
at the time Gargara received colonists. Mualitsh is the modern name
of Miletopolis.</p></div>

&#7944;&#921;&#915;&#913;&#925; &#8033;&#962; &#7944;&#922;&#932;&#913;&#925; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7944;&#929;&#935;&#913;&#925;. There is no doubt that the first of
these words in capitals, to be homonymous with <i>goat</i>, should be &#945;&#7990;&#947;&#945;, as
is read in the old editions, and in many manuscripts, and not &#945;&#7984;&#947;&#8118;, &#945;&#7984;&#947;&#8048;,
or, &#945;&#7984;&#947;&#8048;&#957;, as in others. &#913;&#7990;&#947;&#945; is the accusative of &#913;&#7986;&#958;, (Æx,) <i>a goat</i>,
which name Artemidorus actually gives to this promontory. But as our
language has no termination of cases, the passage requires some explanation.
If the Greeks desired to express in the nominative case the position
of the promontory with respect to the island of Lesbos, they would
say, according to Artemidorus, <i>The cape &AElig;x</i> (&#913;&#7986;&#958;) <i>is in front of Lesbos</i>;
according to Strabo, <i>The cape &AElig;ga</i> (&#913;&#7984;&#947;&#8118;) <i>is in front of Lesbos</i>. The
first, &AElig;x, signifies <i>a goat</i>, as Artemidorus intended; the second, &AElig;ga,
in the Doric dialect (for &AElig;ge, &#913;&#7984;&#947;&#8134;) means a goat&#8217;s skin. If they desired
to employ the word in the accusative, they said, according to Artemidorus,
<i>We have doubled Cape &AElig;ga</i> (&#913;&#7990;&#947;&#945;); according to Strabo, <i>We have
doubled Cape &AElig;gan</i> (&#913;&#7984;&#947;&#8118;&#957;). The matter is clear thus far, but what follows,
&#948;&#949;&#8150; &#948;&#8050; &#956;&#945;&#954;&#961;&#8182;&#962; * * * &#8033;&#962; &#7936;&#954;&#964;&#8118;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#8118;&#957;, is difficult to explain.
The two last words are Doric genitive plurals, the first for &#7936;&#954;&#964;&#8182;&#957;, <i>shores</i>,
the second for &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#8182;&#957;, <i>beginnings</i>; and yet one would expect to find
examples of accusatives in the singular number, as &#7936;&#954;&#964;&#8048;&#957; and &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#8048;&#957;;
the difference of accent is here of no importance, for the last syllables of
these accusatives are long, as Strabo wishes to make the last syllable
long of &AElig;gan (&#913;&#7984;&#947;&#8118;&#957;). If he had required examples agreeing with this
last word in quantity, accent, and case, he might have cited sycan,
(&#963;&#965;&#954;&#8118;&#957;, a fig-tree,) or some other word of this form. It might be supposed
that &#913;&#954;&#964;&#8118;&#957; was here taken in the acceptation [&#7936;&#954;&#964;&#8051;&#951;&#957;, &#7936;&#954;&#964;&#8134;&#957;,
and, in the Doric dialect, &#7936;&#954;&#964;&#8118;&#957;]; but there still remains &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#8118;&#957;, unless
we change the word to &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#964;&#8118;&#957;, <i>a bear&#8217;s skin</i>.&mdash;<i>Cora&yuml;.</i>]

of his friendship. Potamo was professor of rhetoric at Rome, and was
the author of the Perfect Orator, the Life of Alexander the Great, the
Praise of C&aelig;sar, the Praise of Brutus, and the Annals of Samos. Pliny
mentions a sculptor of the name of Lesbocles, whose name seems to indicate
his origin from Lesbos. Athen&aelig;us also names a sculptor from
Mitylene called Lesbothemis. Strabo is probably the only person who
makes mention of Crinagoras. Theophanes is known as an historian, and
especially as the friend of Pompey, whom however he advised to retire to
Egypt. The philosopher Lesbonax, father of Potamo, was a native of
Mitylene.</p></div>

been something real in the dulness of the Cym&aelig;ans; for Cym&aelig;an was
employed by the Greeks as a word synonymous with stupid. C&aelig;sar,
among the Romans, (Plutarch, C&aelig;sar,) adopted this name in the same
sense. This stupidity gave occasion to a proverb, &#8004;&#957;&#959;&#962; &#949;&#7984;&#962; &#954;&#965;&#956;&#945;&#8055;&#959;&#965;&#962;, an

that one would have said they were escaping from an earthquake.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1542" id="Footnote_1542"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1542"><span class="label">1542</span></a> Pliny does not approve of the word Pithecuss&aelig; being derived from
&#960;&#8055;&#952;&#951;&#954;&#959;&#962;, a monkey; but from &#960;&#8055;&#952;&#959;&#962;, a cask. This latter derivation is
not natural, whilst the former is at least conformable to analogy. Hesychius
confirms the Tyrrhenian meaning of the word Arimi, calling
&#7948;&#961;&#953;&#956;&#959;&#962;, &#960;&#8055;&#952;&#951;&#954;&#959;&#962;. The expression in Homer, &#949;&#7984;&#957; &#7944;&#961;&#8055;&#956;&#959;&#953;&#962;, &#8220;among the
Arimi,&#8221; (which in Roman letters would be <i>ein Arimis</i>, and which is
translated into Latin by <i>in Arimis</i>,) signifies &#8220;in the Pithecuss&aelig; Islands,&#8221;
according to the opinion of those who placed Typho&euml;us in Italy.
But it is remarkable that from the two words <i>ein Arimis</i> of Homer the
name <i>Inarimis</i> has been invented; and quoted as Homer&#8217;s by Pliny (iii.
6): &AElig;nasia ipsa, a statione navium &AElig;ne&aelig;, Homero Inarime dicta,
Gr&aelig;cis Pithecussa, non a simiarum multitudine, ut aliqui existimavere
sed a figlinis doliorum. It is not Homer, however, that he ought to
have quoted, but Virgil, who was the first to coin one word out of the two
Greek words.</p>
